/-! # Weighted-simplex truncation: shared definitions

The parity-truncated simplex `K_d`, its boundary segment `H_d` (`truncSegPoint`),
and the endpoint/interior selector `s⋆` (`truncSelector`). Split out of the main
truncation file so both the convexity/reduction helper and the 1-D slice helper can
reference them. -/

/-- For [a total mass and truncation threshold](hyp:M,d) and [a three-coordinate
allocation](hyp:t), the [truncated-simplex membership condition](goal) holds exactly when
[the allocation belongs to the scaled three-point simplex](step:1) and [its second and third
coordinates sum to at least the threshold](step:2).

Membership in the parity-truncated simplex `K_d = {t ∈ Δ_M : t_y + t_z ≥ d}`. -/

  InSimplex M t ∧ d ≤ t 1 + t 2

/-- For [a total mass, threshold, and segment coordinate](hyp:M,d,s), the [truncation-boundary
point](goal) is the three-coordinate allocation whose first coordinate is the total mass
minus the threshold, whose second coordinate is the segment coordinate, and whose third
coordinate is the threshold minus that coordinate.

The boundary segment `H_d`: the point with `t_x = M − d`, `t_y = s`, `t_z = d − s`. -/
def truncSegPoint (M d s : ℝ) : Fin 3 → ℝ := ![M - d, s, d - s]

/-- Given [a total mass and threshold](hyp:M,d), [three linear coefficients and three
weights](hyp:α,β), and [a scale](hyp:kappa), the [boundary-segment selector](goal) first
sets the difference of the second and third coefficients to $δ$ [as its first
intermediate quantity](step:1) and the weighted squared first coordinate to $A$ as its
second intermediate quantity; it then returns zero when $δ$ is at least
$κ d/\sqrt{A+d^2}$, returns $d$ when $δ$ is at most its negative, and otherwise
returns $(d-δ\sqrt{(A+d^2/2)/(\kappa^2-δ^2/2)})/2$.

The endpoint/interior selector `s⋆` on `H_d`, with `δ = α_y − α_z`
and `A = β_x (M − d)²`:
`s⋆ = 0` if `δ ≥ κ d / √(A + d²)`, `s⋆ = d` if `δ ≤ − κ d / √(A + d²)`, and
otherwise the interior root `s⋆ = (d − δ √((A + d²/2)/(κ² − δ²/2)))/2`.
At `κ = 0` the two guards collapse to `0 ≤ δ` and `δ ≤ 0`, recovering the
`κ = 0` endpoint rule `s⋆ = 0` if `δ ≥ 0`, `s⋆ = d` if `δ ≤ 0`. -/
