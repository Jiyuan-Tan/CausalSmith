/-! # Value assignments over finite node sets

This file provides the graph- and model-agnostic value-space infrastructure shared by the
structural-causal-model and potential-outcome frameworks: typed value assignments over a finite
node set (`ValuesOn`), their measurable coordinate restrictions, and the canonical measurable
equivalence and measure transport between assignments over propositionally equal node sets.

Nothing here mentions graphs, SWIGs, or the `SCM` structure — it is pure product-space
bookkeeping over a finite index `Finset`, so it lives in the `Mathlib` staging area rather than
in `SCM/`. The restriction map coincides with Mathlib's `Finset.restrict₂`; we keep the named
`valuesProjection`/`ValuesOn` vocabulary because it reads better at the many downstream call
sites and because `simp` lemmas throughout the library are keyed on these names.

/-- Given an [underlying collection of nodes](hyp:M), a [finite node set](hyp:I), and [a family
of value spaces, one for each node](hyp:Ω), a [value assignment over that finite node set](goal)
gives each node in the set one value from its associated value space. -/

/-- Given an [underlying collection of nodes](hyp:M), [finite node sets](hyp:I), [a family
of measurable value spaces, one for each node](hyp:Ω), and [evidence that the second node set is
contained in the first](hyp:hJI), the [coordinate-restriction map](goal) sends each assignment on
the first set to its values on the second set.

    This coincides definitionally with Mathlib's `Finset.restrict₂`; we keep the explicit
    lambda body because a large number of downstream proofs `simp [valuesProjection]` and rely
    on it unfolding to `fun ξ j => ξ ⟨j.val, hJI j.property⟩`. -/

/-- For value assignments over a finite node set, if [a finite node set `J` is a subset of a
larger finite node set `I`](hyp:hJI), then [restricting a value assignment over `I` to its
coordinates in `J` is a measurable map](goal).

    Coordinate restriction `valuesProjection hJI` is measurable; since it coincides with
    `Finset.restrict₂ hJI`, measurability is exactly `Finset.measurable_restrict₂`. -/

restriction to `W`, from the measurable space on value assignments over `W` is a sub-σ-algebra
of the ambient measurable space on value assignments over `I`](goal).

    The comap of `valuesProjection` gives a sub-σ-algebra of the ambient
    measurable space on `ValuesOn I Ω`. -/

/-- Given an [underlying collection of nodes](hyp:M), [finite node sets](hyp:I), [a family
of measurable value spaces, one for each node](hyp:Ω), and [an equality of the two node
sets](hyp:h), the [canonical measurable equivalence](goal) identifies assignments over the first
set with assignments over the second set by retaining the corresponding coordinate values.

    `ValuesOn I Ω` and `ValuesOn J Ω` are canonically measurably-equivalent when the
    index `Finset`s agree propositionally.  Packages the `valuesProjection`
    inverse pair so call sites avoid ad-hoc `▸`/`HEq` on the `Subtype` index. -/

/-- Given [two propositionally equal finite node sets `I` and `J`](hyp:h) and [a family `μ` of

value assignments over `I` and over `J` carries the product measure `Measure.pi μ` to the
product measure built from `μ` re-indexed along `J` through the equality](goal).

    `Measure.pi` transports along `valuesEquivOfEq`: the equiv is measure-preserving
    between the two `Measure.pi`'s whose per-coordinate measures agree through the
    subtype transport of the index equality. -/
