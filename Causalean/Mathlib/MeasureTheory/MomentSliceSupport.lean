# Moment-slice extreme-point support bound (Richter–Rogosinski / Winkler)

Let `K = [a,b]` be a compact interval and `s : ℝ`.  The *moment slice* is the set of
probability measures on `K` with mean `0` and second moment `s`:

    C = { μ | μ Kᶜ = 0 ∧ ∫ x ∂μ = 0 ∧ ∫ x² ∂μ = s }.

This file proves the support-size part of the Richter–Rogosinski / Karr / Winkler
*canonical representation* theorem for this two-moment slice.  It starts with the
finite-atom perturbation argument: three homogeneous linear constraints (total mass,
mean, second moment) on four-or-more atom weights always admit a nonzero perturbation
`δ`, and `μ ± ε·δ` are then two distinct measures of `C` whose midpoint is `μ`,
contradicting extremality.  The later support argument upgrades this from a finite atom
set to an arbitrary extreme probability measure in the slice.

Main results:
* `exists_moment_perturbation` — pure linear algebra: on `4`-or-more reals there is a
  nonzero weight perturbation killing the three moments `1, x, x²` simultaneously.
* `card_le_three_of_isExtremePoint` — an extreme point of the moment slice supported on a
  finite positive-weight atom set has at most three atoms.
* `exists_isMinOn_momentSlice` — on a compact Hausdorff space the moment slice is weak-*
  compact, so a bounded-continuous objective attains its minimum over the slice.
* `support_finite_ncard_le_three_of_isExtremePoint` — any extreme probability measure in
  the two-moment slice has finite topological support of cardinality at most three.
* `isAtomic_le_three_of_isExtremePoint` and
  `exists_cardSupportLe_three_of_isExtremePoint` — the same conclusion as a positive
  discrete-measure representation and as a finite support carrier.
