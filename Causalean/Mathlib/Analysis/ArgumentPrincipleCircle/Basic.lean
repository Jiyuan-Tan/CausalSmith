# Circle argument-principle definitions and local residue

This module provides the normalized logarithmic-derivative integral around a
positively oriented complex circle, the associated multiplicity-weighted zero
count in its open disk, and the local factorization behind their relationship.

/-- For [a complex-valued function](hyp:f), [a complex center](hyp:c), and [a real radius](hyp:R), [the normalized logarithmic-derivative circle integral](goal) is the integral of the function's logarithmic derivative around the positively oriented circle with that center and radius, divided by $2\pi i$.

This quantity is the winding count obtained by integrating the logarithmic derivative of a
complex-valued function around a positively oriented circle and scaling so that one enclosed
simple zero contributes one. -/

/-- For [a complex-valued function](hyp:f), [a complex center](hyp:c), and [a real radius](hyp:R), [the zero-multiplicity count](goal) is the sum of the analytic multiplicities of all zeros of the function lying strictly inside the open disk with that center and radius, with the standard totalized finite sum used when the support is not finite.

This count adds the analytic multiplicity of every zero strictly inside a given open disk;
outside finite-support settings it uses the standard totalized finite sum. -/

/-- For [a complex-valued function](hyp:f), [a complex center](hyp:c), and [a real radius](hyp:R), [the interior-zero set](goal) consists exactly of the complex numbers that are zeros of the function and lie strictly inside the open disk with that center and radius.

This set comprises exactly the zeros of a complex-valued function that lie strictly inside a
given open disk. -/

/-- Near a finite-order zero of an analytic complex function, its logarithmic derivative is the
zero multiplicity divided by displacement from the zero plus the logarithmic derivative of an
analytic factor that does not vanish there. -/
