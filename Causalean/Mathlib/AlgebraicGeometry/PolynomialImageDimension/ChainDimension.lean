/-- For [a coordinate index set](hyp:ι), [a nonnegative integer $d$](hyp:d), and [a subset $Z$ of the corresponding complex affine space](hyp:Z), [the statement that $Z$ has exact affine Zariski dimension $d$](goal) means that [there exists a strictly increasing chain of $d+1$ irreducible affine-closed subsets, all contained in $Z$](step:1), and [no strictly increasing chain of $d+2$ irreducible affine-closed subsets, all contained in $Z$, exists](step:2).

Exact affine Zariski dimension is the largest number of strict containments in a chain of nonempty irreducible polynomially closed subsets of a set. -/
