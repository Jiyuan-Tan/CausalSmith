# Finite Poisson samples

This file turns an independent Poisson count and infinite i.i.d. stream into a
genuine finite sequence.  It records the count law and the exact, unnormalised
fixed-count fibre law.  The latter is the convenient measure-theoretic form of
the statement that, conditional on the count, the observations are i.i.d.

/-- The Poisson law with mean `r` gives the single count `n` exactly the Poisson
probability mass at `n`.

This bridge used to hold by definition, because the Poisson law was *defined* as
the measure attached to the Poisson mass function.  Mathlib now defines it
primitively, as a weighted sum of point masses, so the two descriptions have to
be reconciled explicitly.  Every result phrased against the mass function needs
this lemma to be transported to the Poisson law, so it is stated once here for
the whole `FiniteMarkedPoissonPartition` family rather than re-proved per file. -/
