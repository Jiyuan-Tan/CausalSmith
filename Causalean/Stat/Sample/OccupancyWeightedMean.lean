# Occupancy-weighted within-group means

This module provides totalized occupancy-weighted differences of within-group
sample means and a weak-second-moment variance bound under fixed overlap. The
API covers empty samples, empty group types, zero-mass groups, and empirical
zero-count boundaries without imposing bounded outcomes.
