/-- Given [an observation space](hyp:𝒳), [a nonnegative sample size](hyp:N), [a sample indexed by the integers from zero through one less than that size](hyp:sample), and [a point in the observation space](hyp:x), [the empirical mass of that point](goal) is the reciprocal of the sample size multiplied by the number of sampled observations equal to that point.

The empirical mass of a point is the fraction of sample observations equal to that point. -/
