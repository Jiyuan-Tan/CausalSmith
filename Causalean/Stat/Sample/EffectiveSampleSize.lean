# Kish dispersion and effective sample size

This module develops the empirical second-moment statistic used for weighted
i.i.d. samples. When weights have population mean one, their second moment is
the Kish design effect; dividing the nominal sample size by this design effect
gives the effective sample size. The results below establish its mean, a
variance bound under a fourth-moment envelope, and a lower-tail bound.

/-- Given [an observation space](hyp:Ω), [a real-valued weight function on that space](hyp:g), [a nonnegative sample size](hyp:n), and [a sample indexed by the integers from zero through one less than that size](hyp:sample), [the empirical Kish dispersion](goal) is the reciprocal of the sample size multiplied by the sum of the squared weights of the sampled observations.

Empirical Kish dispersion is the sample average of the squared observation-level weights. -/
