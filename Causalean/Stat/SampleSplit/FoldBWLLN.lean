# Fold-B weak law of large numbers

Generic weak law of large numbers restricted to the estimation fold `B(n)` of a
`OneShotSplit`.  For a fixed, square-integrable statistic `g`, the fold-B sample
mean `|B(n)|⁻¹ Σ_{i ∈ B(n)} g (Z i)` converges in probability to the population
integral `∫ g dP`.

Unlike the full-sample WLLN (`IIDSample.sampleMean_tendsto_inProb`, which is
SLLN-based and ranges over the prefix `{0, …, N−1}`), this lemma works directly
on the growing fold-B index set.  It complements the fold-B `oₚ(1)`
nuisance-vanishing lemmas, which only handle statistics whose mean is zero.

The proof is a textbook Chebyshev argument: fold-B independence (and identical
distribution) gives mean `∫ g dP` and variance `Var[g] / |B(n)|` for the fold-B
average; Chebyshev's inequality then bounds the deviation probability by
`Var[g] / (ε² |B(n)|)`, which vanishes because `|B(n)| → ∞`.

/-! # Fold-B Weak Law of Large Numbers

This file provides a weak law of large numbers for the estimation fold of a
one-shot sample split: the fold-B average of a fixed square-integrable statistic
converges in probability to its population mean. It is the substrate that lets a
fold-B average of a fixed function converge to its mean, as opposed to the
existing fold-B lemmas which only treat the nuisance-vanishing regime. -/

/-- **Chebyshev squeeze for convergence in probability.**  If a sequence `Yn`
has constant mean `c` and a Chebyshev tail bound `Var / (ε² b n)` that vanishes
because `b n → ∞`, then `Yn` converges in probability to the constant `c`.

This is a convenience packaging of the standard `0 ≤ … ≤ (vanishing bound)`
squeeze used to turn a Chebyshev inequality into convergence in measure. -/

/-- **Fold-B weak law of large numbers.** For an i.i.d. sample and a one-shot split into a
nuisance fold and an estimation fold, given [a measurable statistic `g`](hyp:hg_meas) that is
[square-integrable under the population measure](hyp:hg_memLp), [the estimation-fold sample
average of `g` converges in probability to the population integral $\int g\,dP$ as the sample size
grows](goal).

This restricts the weak law of large numbers to the estimation fold of the split:
the fold-B index set grows without bound, so the standard Chebyshev argument
(mean `∫ g dP`, variance `Var[g] / |B(n)|`) gives convergence in probability. -/
