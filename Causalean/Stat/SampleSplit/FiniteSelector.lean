# Finite pilot-selected L2 transfer

This module transfers uniform squared-risk bounds through a finite branch
chosen from an independent pilot sample. It also bounds the full risk after a
controlled bad pilot event and supplies the corresponding one-shot iid split
bridge.

The construction expands the selected risk over measurable selector cells and
uses independence to factor each cell probability from its fixed-branch tail
risk. The statements are neutral about the meaning of the branches and sample
coordinates.
