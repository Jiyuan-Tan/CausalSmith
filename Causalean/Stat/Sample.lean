# I.i.d. sample model

Causal-agnostic statistical primitive: an i.i.d. sample on a single ambient
probability space, matching Mathlib's `iIndepFun` / `IdentDistrib` idiom rather
than the product-space construction.  See `def:est-iid-sample` in
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation.tex`.

This file is intentionally project-agnostic and is a candidate for upstream
contribution to Mathlib.

/-! # I.i.d. Samples

This file provides the library's causal-agnostic model of an independent and
identically distributed sample on a common ambient probability space. It also
defines sample means of real-valued statistics along the first \(n\) sample
points, supplying the base object used by the limit and inference modules. -/

/-- An independent and identically distributed sample with marginal law `P`, realized as
[a sequence of sample points](hyp:Z) given by [measurable maps](hyp:meas) on a single
ambient probability space: [the family is mutually independent](hyp:indep), [identically
distributed](hyp:identDist), and [the law of each point is the population law `P`](hyp:law).

* `Z i : Ω → X`             — the `i`-th sample point.
* `meas`                    — measurability of each `Z i`.
* `indep`                   — mutual independence of the family under `μ`.
* `identDist`               — every `Z i` is identically distributed with `Z 0`.
* `law`                     — the law of `Z 0` matches the population law `P`.

Together, `identDist` and `law` give `μ.map (Z i) = P` for all `i`. -/

/-- Each individual sample point of an i.i.d. sample is a measurable map from the ambient
probability space to the observation space.

This is the `meas` field with the sample index instantiated. The field itself is stated for
all indices at once, which the function-property tactics cannot use; this per-index form is
the one they can. -/

/-- For [a measurable sample space carrying a measure](hyp:Ω,μ), [a measurable observation space carrying a population measure](hyp:X,P), [an independent and identically distributed sample from that population](hyp:S), [a real-valued statistic of one observation](hyp:f), and [a nonnegative integer sample size](hyp:n), the [sample mean](goal) is the function that assigns each sample-space outcome the average $n^{-1}\sum_{i<n} f(Z_i)$, with the reciprocal convention also applying when $n=0$.

This is the empirical mean over the first `n` observations. -/
