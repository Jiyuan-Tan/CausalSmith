# Gaussian half-line tail control

A generic fact about probability laws on the real line: each one-sided half-line
tail can be made smaller than any `ε > 0` by pushing the cutoff out. Both half-line
families `(-∞, -n]` and `[n, ∞)` shrink to `∅`, so continuity from above of the
(finite) measure sends their mass to `0`.

Factored out of the sample-quantile rate proof (where it discharges the L4 tail
ingredient) so it can be reused by the Imbens–Manski coverage argument in
`PO/ID/Partial/Inference/ImbensManski.lean` without importing the
quantile-Bahadur tower.

/-! # Gaussian Tail Control

This file proves that both one-sided tails of a centered Gaussian distribution
can be made arbitrarily small by choosing a sufficiently large cutoff. The result
is a reusable tightness ingredient for quantile and partial-identification
asymptotic arguments.

The exported lemma `finite_measure_halfline_tails_small` applies to every finite measure on
the real line. Its Gaussian corollary `gaussian_tail_small_gaussian` applies to
the project's `gaussianMeasure m v`, including the clipped degenerate case for
nonpositive variance parameters. Both return one positive cutoff controlling the
lower and upper half-line tails. -/

/-- **Finite-measure half-line tail control.** For a finite measure `Q` on the real line and
[a positive tolerance `ε`](hyp:hε), [there is a positive cutoff `R` such that both the lower
half-line tail $Q((-\infty,-R])$ and the upper half-line tail $Q([R,\infty))$ are at most
`ε`](goal). -/
