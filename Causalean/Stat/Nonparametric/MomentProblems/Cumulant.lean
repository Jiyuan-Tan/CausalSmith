# Cumulants of real random variables, and the Gaussian-law predicate

This module provides the general moment-to-cumulant coordinates used throughout the
moment-problem layer: the joint cumulant of a pair of real random variables at a given
bidegree (defined by the set-partition Möbius formula on mixed moments), the univariate
cumulant of a single real random variable obtained by specializing it, and the predicate
"this law on the real line is a Gaussian law".

These are the plain textbook objects: the second cumulant is the variance, the third is the
centered third moment, the fourth is the excess kurtosis, and a Gaussian law is exactly a law
whose cumulants above order two all vanish.  The Gaussian predicate here is the *distributional*
one — being some `gaussianReal` with a mean and a variance, degenerate Diracs included — and is
the form in which non-Gaussianity assumptions (as in linear non-Gaussian causal discovery) are
stated.

/-- For [a measure on the real line](hyp:ν), the [Gaussian-law property](goal) holds exactly when
there exist a real mean and a nonnegative variance parameter such that the measure is the associated
normal distribution. The variance parameter may be zero, so point masses count as degenerate Gaussian laws.

A probability law on the real line is a **Gaussian law** when it is a normal distribution:
there is a mean and a (possibly zero) variance whose normal distribution is exactly this law.
Allowing zero variance means the point masses (Diracs) count as degenerate Gaussians, so the
negation "not a Gaussian law" is the strongest possible non-Gaussianity requirement. -/

/-- Given [a sample space equipped with a σ-algebra](hyp:Ω), [a measure on that space](hyp:μ),
[two real-valued random variables](hyp:X,Y), and [two nonnegative integer orders](hyp:p,q), the
[joint cumulant at the specified bidegree](goal) is the sum over every partition of the combined
slots, with the first $p$ slots assigned to the first variable and the remaining $q$ slots assigned
to the second, of a signed factorial weight times the product, across its blocks, of the mixed moment whose
exponents equal that block's counts of first- and second-variable slots.

The **joint cumulant** of two real random variables at bidegree `(p, q)`: the cumulant of the
first variable taken `p` times together with the second taken `q` times.  It is obtained from the
mixed moments by the classical set-partition (Möbius) inversion — sum over all partitions of the
`p + q` slots of a signed factorial weight times the product, over the blocks of the partition, of
the mixed moment matching how many first-variable and second-variable slots that block contains.

For centered variables this reproduces the familiar formulae: bidegree `(2, 0)` is the variance,
`(1, 1)` is the covariance, and bidegree `(4, 0)` is the excess kurtosis. -/

/-- Given [a sample space equipped with a σ-algebra](hyp:Ω), [a measure on that space](hyp:μ),
[a real-valued random variable](hyp:S), and [a nonnegative integer order](hyp:r), the [cumulant of
that order](goal) is the joint cumulant obtained by placing that same variable in every slot.

The **cumulant of order `r`** of a single real random variable: the joint cumulant of the
variable with itself in which every slot is filled by that one variable.  Order two is the
variance, order three the centered third moment, order four the excess kurtosis. -/
