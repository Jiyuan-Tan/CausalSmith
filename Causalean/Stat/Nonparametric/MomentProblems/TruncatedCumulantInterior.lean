# The truncated cumulant range has nonempty interior

The main result of this module says that the truncated cumulant sequences of orders two through
`L` attainable by *centered, non-Gaussian* probability laws on the real line with finite `L`-th
moment fill up a set with nonempty interior: there is one attainable cumulant vector all of whose
sufficiently small perturbations are again attainable by such a law.

The proof is constructive rather than an appeal to the general (truncated Hamburger) moment
problem.  Put `L + 1` distinct equally spaced symmetric atoms on the line.  Matching the first
`L + 1` raw moments of a weight vector to a target is then a linear system with a transposed
Vandermonde matrix, hence invertible, and the moment target itself is obtained from the cumulant
target by the triangular moment↔cumulant inversion — so weights depend continuously on the
prescribed cumulants (`SymmetricAtomSolve`).  At the uniform weight vector all weights are strictly
positive, and positivity is an open condition, so every nearby cumulant target still solves to
strictly positive weights, i.e. to a genuine probability law.  That law is centered (the atoms are
symmetric and the first-moment equation is part of the solved system), has all moments finite
(finite support), and is non-Gaussian (at least two atoms carry positive mass).

The order `L = 0` case is degenerate — a single atom would be a point mass, i.e. a degenerate
Gaussian — and is handled separately by an explicit fair two-point law on `±1`.

/-- For [a nonnegative truncation order](hyp:L), the [interior-of-the-truncated-cumulant-range
condition](goal) says that [there exist a real cumulant sequence and a strictly positive real
radius](step:1) such that every real sequence whose entries of every order from two through the
truncation order differ from the corresponding target entries by less than that radius is the
cumulant sequence, at each of those orders, of some centered non-Gaussian probability law on the
real line with finite moment of the truncation order.

Equivalently: the set of truncated cumulant sequences of orders `2, …, L` attainable by centered
non-Gaussian laws with `L` moments has nonempty interior.  This is what one needs in order to
perturb a "generic" cumulant configuration freely without leaving the model class — for instance to
move a parameter off an exceptional algebraic locus while staying inside the non-Gaussian source
model of linear non-Gaussian causal discovery. -/

finite zeroth moment works; the fair two-point law on `±1` is one. -/

/-- **The truncated cumulant range has nonempty interior.** For [every truncation order `L`](hyp:L),
[there is a cumulant vector, of orders two through `L`, together with a strictly positive radius,
such that every cumulant vector within that radius is the truncated cumulant vector of some
centered, non-Gaussian probability law on the real line with finite `L`-th moment](goal).

The witness is an explicit finite atomic law on `L + 1` equally spaced symmetric atoms whose weights
are recovered from the target moments by inverting a Vandermonde system, the target moments in turn
coming from the target cumulants by the triangular moment–cumulant inversion.  Both steps are
continuous, and the uniform-weight law sits strictly inside the weight-positivity constraints, so a
whole neighborhood of cumulant targets stays realizable. -/
