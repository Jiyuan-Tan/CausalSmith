# Finite atomic laws on the real line

This module builds the finitely supported probability laws used as explicit witnesses in
truncated moment problems: a finite list of distinct real atom locations carrying a matching list
of weights.  It records how such a law integrates an arbitrary function (a weighted sum over the
atoms), when it is a probability measure, how much mass it puts on each atom, that all of its
moments are finite (the support is bounded), and that it is never Gaussian as soon as two atoms
carry strictly positive mass.

The last fact is what makes finite atomic laws usable as non-Gaussian witnesses: a nondegenerate
normal law has no atoms at all, and a degenerate one is a single point mass, so two distinct atoms
of positive mass rule out both cases.
