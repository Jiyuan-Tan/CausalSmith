# Quantile function (generalized inverse of a cdf)

Causal-agnostic statistical primitive: a lower generalized inverse of
Mathlib's `cdf` for a real measure. For probability measures this is the usual
left-continuous quantile function:

    quantile μ τ := sInf {x : ℝ | τ ≤ cdf μ x}.

Mathlib provides `ProbabilityTheory.cdf μ : StieltjesFunction ℝ` (monotone,
right-continuous, with limits 0 / 1) but has **no** generalized inverse; this
file supplies it together with the key order characterisation

    quantile μ τ ≤ x  ↔  τ ≤ cdf μ x       (for `0 < τ < 1`),

i.e. the Galois-style connection between the cdf and its inverse.  This is the
foundation for quantile treatment effects (`PO/ID/Exact/QTE/QuantileEffect.lean`)
and the quantile form of Lee trimming.

The interior restriction `0 < τ < 1` is intrinsic: for `τ ≤ 0` the defining set
is all of `ℝ` (so `sInf = 0` is meaningless) and for `τ ≥ 1` it can be empty in
the continuous, full-support case.  These are exactly the degenerate quantiles.
File is project-agnostic and a candidate for upstream contribution to Mathlib.

/-! # Quantile Function

This file defines the lower quantile function of a real probability measure as
the generalized inverse of its cumulative distribution function. It proves the
basic order characterization that connects cumulative distribution functions and
their quantiles away from the degenerate endpoints. -/
