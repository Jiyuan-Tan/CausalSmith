# Empirical (sample-variance) Bernstein infrastructure

This file develops the **sample variance** of an i.i.d. sample, an **elementary,
fully rigorous** population-variance concentration bound, and a *data-driven*
Bernstein confidence interval built on top of it.

The full Maurer–Pontil empirical-Bernstein bound is research-level and out of
scope; we take the *elementary* route instead.  Writing `m := ∫ f ∂P`,
`σ² := ∫ (f − m)² ∂P`, `X̄ₙ := S.sampleMean f n` and `V̂ₙ := S.sampleVariance f n`,
the population–sample variance gap decomposes (using `σ² = μ₂ − m²` with
`μ₂ := ∫ f² ∂P`, and `V̂ₙ = M̂₂ − X̄ₙ²` with `M̂₂ := (1/n) Σ f(Zᵢ)²`) as

    σ² − V̂ₙ = (μ₂ − M̂₂) + (X̄ₙ² − m²).

With `f` valued in `[a, b]` a.e. and `M := max |a| |b|` (so `|f| ≤ M`, hence
`|m|, |X̄ₙ| ≤ M` and `f² ∈ [0, M²]`), each gap term is controlled by a Hoeffding
deviation at level `δ/2`.  Writing `d := √(log(4/δ) / (2n))`:

* `μ₂ − M̂₂` is the centered deviation of `g := f²` on `[0, M²]`, so on a good
  event `|μ₂ − M̂₂| ≤ M²·d`;
* `X̄ₙ² − m² = (X̄ₙ − m)(X̄ₙ + m)` with `|X̄ₙ + m| ≤ 2M`, and on a good event
  `|X̄ₙ − m| ≤ (b − a)·d`, so `|X̄ₙ² − m²| ≤ 2M(b − a)·d`.

A union bound over the two Hoeffding tail events (each at level `δ/2`) gives the
*deterministic* slack

    empiricalVarianceSlack a b n δ := M²·d + 2 M (b − a)·d

and `empirical_variance_concentration`: `P(V̂ₙ + τ < σ²) ≤ δ`.  Feeding the
resulting `σ ≤ √(V̂ₙ + τ)` into the (oracle) Bernstein half-width then yields a
confidence interval whose width is computed from the **observed** sample variance
(`empirical_bernstein_ci_miss`, total miss probability `≤ 2δ`).

The constants here are looser than Maurer–Pontil's because the second-moment
Hoeffding step is wasteful, but the route is elementary and keeps the
data-driven interval explicit.

/-! # Empirical Bernstein confidence intervals

This file develops the sample-variance layer needed for data-driven Bernstein
intervals. It defines `IIDSample.sampleVariance` and proves its nonnegativity,
measurability, and computational identity; defines the deterministic slack
`empiricalVarianceSlack`; proves `empirical_variance_concentration`, a
high-probability upper bound on the population variance by observed sample
variance plus slack; and proves `empirical_bernstein_ci_miss`, an empirical
Bernstein miss-probability theorem whose half-width is
`empiricalBernsteinCIHalfWidth`.

/-! ## Data-driven population-variance bound -/

/-- Given [real interval endpoints $a$ and $b$](hyp:a,b), [a natural-number sample size $n$](hyp:n), and [a real confidence level $\delta$](hyp:δ), the [empirical-variance slack](goal) is $\max\{|a|,|b|\}^2\sqrt{\log(4/\delta)/(2n)}+2\max\{|a|,|b|\}(b-a)\sqrt{\log(4/\delta)/(2n)}$.

The deterministic slack added to the observed sample variance to upper-bound
the population variance with probability `≥ 1 − δ`.  With `M := max |a| |b|` and
`d := √(log(4/δ)/(2n))` the (level `δ/2`) Hoeffding deviation factor, it is
`M²·d + 2 M (b − a)·d`.  The first term controls the second-moment deviation
(`f²` on `[0, M²]`), the second the squared-mean deviation
(`|X̄ₙ² − m²| ≤ 2M·|X̄ₙ − m|`). -/

/-- **Data-driven (empirical) Bernstein confidence interval, miss-probability form.** Let `S` be an
i.i.d. sample and let `f` be [a measurable statistic](hyp:hf) taking values in [an interval
`[a,b]` with `a < b`](hyp:hab,hbound_ab), with population mean `m = ∫ f ∂P`. Suppose [`c` is a
nonnegative bound with `f` deviating from `m` by at most `c`, `P`-almost
everywhere](hyp:hc,hbound), [the population variance `σ² = ∫ (f − m)² ∂P` is strictly
positive](hyp:hposvar), [the sample size `n` is positive](hyp:hn), and [the confidence level `δ`
lies in `(0, 1]`](hyp:hδ0,hδ1). Then [the population mean `m` falls outside the random,
data-driven interval `[X̄ₙ − ŵ(ω), X̄ₙ + ŵ(ω)]` — whose half-width `ŵ(ω) =
empiricalBernsteinCIHalfWidth S f a b c n δ ω` is computed from the observed sample variance via
`√(V̂ₙ(ω) + τ)` — with probability at most `2δ`](goal).

The proof unions two level-`δ` failure events: the oracle Bernstein miss (with the
true `σ = √σ²`) and the variance-bound failure `σ² > V̂ₙ + τ`.  On the good
variance event `σ ≤ √(V̂ₙ + τ)`, so monotonicity of the Bernstein half-width in `σ`
makes the data-driven width at least the oracle width, hence the data-driven miss
event is contained in the oracle miss event. -/
