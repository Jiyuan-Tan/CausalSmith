# Rademacher complexity imports from `FoML.Defs`

This file imports the FoML definitions of Rademacher complexity and bounded
difference tools, then adds Causalean-specific congruence lemmas in the
`Causalean.Stat.Concentration` namespace. The FoML definitions themselves
remain root-namespace symbols exposed by the imports; this file does not create
Causalean-qualified aliases for them.

The imported FoML development is MIT-licensed; see the FoML package metadata
for provenance and license terms.

Re-exports FoML Rademacher-complexity primitives and adds congruence lemmas for empirical and
population complexities.

The FoML symbols (`Signs`, `empiricalRademacherComplexity`,
`rademacherComplexity`, `empiricalRademacherComplexity_without_abs`,
`uniformDeviation`, `uniformDeviation_measurable`) live in the root
namespace and are imported transitively above. We declare the namespace
`Causalean.Stat.Concentration` so that downstream `open
Causalean.Stat.Concentration` continues to elaborate, but we do not
re-export the FoML names — root-namespace symbols are already in scope
unqualified, and declaring `abbrev` aliases here would trigger
ambiguous-term errors when both forms are visible.

We also collect a few generic congruence facts for empirical and population
Rademacher complexity (invariance under sample-pointwise / almost-everywhere
agreement of the function family). The public lemmas are
`empiricalRademacherComplexity_congr_sample`,
`rademacherComplexity_congr_ae`, and `rademacherComplexity_congr_ae_all`,
which let callers replace a function class by an equal-on-samples or
almost-everywhere equal representative without changing the corresponding
Rademacher complexity.

/-- The population Rademacher complexity is unchanged under an
almost-everywhere agreement of the whole family at once: if almost every `ω`
satisfies `f i (sample ω) = f' i (sample ω)` for all indices `i`
simultaneously, the two families have equal Rademacher complexity.

This is the joint-event variant of `rademacherComplexity_congr_ae`: it consumes
a single a.e. statement quantified over all indices, rather than one a.e.
statement per index, so it does not need `[Countable ι]`. -/
