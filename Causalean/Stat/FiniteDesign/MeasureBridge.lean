/-! # Measure-theoretic bridges for finite-design operations

For a finite design `D`, `FiniteDesign.E`, `FiniteDesign.Var`, and `FiniteDesign.Pr` are the design
expectation, variance, and event probability.  This file exposes them as the integral, variance, and
event measure of `D.toMeasure`, and proves that every statistic is `Lᵖ` under `D.toMeasure`
(`memLp_toMeasure`) and strongly measurable (`aestronglyMeasurable_toMeasure`).  These are the
standard side conditions needed to reuse measure-theoretic results with finite designs.

assignment space is `Lᵖ` under the design measure: the space is finite so every statistic is
bounded, and the design measure is a probability measure, so every power is integrable. -/

/-- **Cauchy–Schwarz for the design covariance.** In any finite design, [the absolute covariance of
two statistics `X` and `Y` is at most the product of their design standard deviations,

Obtained from the general covariance Cauchy–Schwarz inequality via the measure bridge; the design
side has no self-contained proof of it. -/
