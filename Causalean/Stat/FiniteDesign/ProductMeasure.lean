/-! # Product-design measures

The measure induced by a finite product design is Mathlib's product measure.

`prodDesign_toMeasure_eq_pi` identifies `(prodDesign D).toMeasure` with
`Measure.pi (fun i => (D i).toMeasure)`, using `FiniteDesign.toMeasure_singleton` to compare
singleton masses.  The independence results `iIndepFun_prodDesign_eval`,
`indepFun_prodDesign_eval`, `indepFun_prodDesign_blocks`, and
`indepFun_prodDesign_apply_blocks` then expose Mathlib's product-measure independence for
coordinate projections and disjoint coordinate blocks.

/-- **The product design IS Mathlib's product measure.** For [a family of independent coordinate
designs `D`](hyp:D), [the probability measure induced by the product design `prodDesign D`
coincides exactly with Mathlib's product measure of the coordinate design measures](goal). Both
are finite measures on the Fintype `∀ i, α i`, so they agree iff they agree on every singleton
`{w}`; on a singleton both sides evaluate to `∏ i, (D i).p (w i)`. -/

/-- **Disjoint-block independence.** For [a family of independent coordinate designs `D`](hyp:D),
suppose [the finite index sets `A` and `B` are disjoint](hyp:hAB). Then [the tuple of coordinates
indexed by `A` is probabilistically independent of the tuple of coordinates indexed by `B`, under
the measure induced by the product design](goal). This is the form a diagonal dependency graph
`G a b := a = b` consumes. -/

function families to the coordinates in two disjoint blocks preserves their independence, even
when the two blocks have different coordinatewise output spaces. -/

/-- **General functions of disjoint coordinate blocks are independent.**  The strict generalization
of `indepFun_prodDesign_apply_blocks` from coordinatewise-separable maps `(g k (w k))_k` to
*arbitrary* measurable functions that each depend only on a block: if `F` is unchanged by any
assignment that agrees on `S`, and `G` is unchanged by any assignment that agrees on the disjoint
set `T`, then `F` and `G` are independent under the product-design measure.  This is the hypothesis
a dependency-graph construction actually consumes, where each summand depends jointly (not
coordinatewise) on a neighbourhood block. -/
