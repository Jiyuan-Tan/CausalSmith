# The minimax value of a statistical decision problem

This module packages the object `inf over estimators of sup over the model class of the risk`
and its elementary order API. The estimator family and the model class enter as bare index
types, so a run instantiates them at whatever subtype carries its admissibility and
membership conditions.

Provided here: `worstCaseRisk` (the supremum of one estimator's risk over the class),
`minimaxValue` (the infimum of that over the estimators), the four facts every minimax
argument needs about them — nonnegativity, "any admissible estimator is an upper bound",
"a bound uniform over admissible estimators is a lower bound", "shrinking the class cannot
raise the value" — a two-point reduction stated directly against the minimax value, and
bridges to the equivalent set-comprehension spelling `sInf {r | ∃ e, ...}`.

Conventions for degenerate problems. Real suprema and infima are only conditionally
complete, so an empty index or an unbounded range evaluates to the junk value zero.
This module keeps that convention rather than hiding it, because zero is the conservative
value here: it makes an empty estimator family or an empty model class yield minimax value
zero, which can never certify a positive lower bound. (Contrast `coverageInfOrOne` in
`Causalean/Stat/Minimax/HonestConfidenceSet.lean`, where the guarantee runs the other way
and the safe vacuous value is one.) Accordingly the lemmas below carry explicit
`Nonempty` / `BddAbove` / `BddBelow` hypotheses, and each comes with a `_of_nonneg`
companion that discharges those hypotheses from nonnegativity of the risk, which is what
squared-error, absolute-error and regret losses supply for free.

Everything is stated over `ℝ`. A problem whose loss lives in `ℝ≥0∞` needs none of this
packaging: that order is a complete lattice, so `iInf_le`, `le_iInf`, `le_iSup` and
`iSup_le` apply with no side conditions at all.

/-- Given an [estimator class](hyp:E), a [model class](hyp:Θ), a [real-valued risk for each
estimator-model pair](hyp:risk), and an [estimator](hyp:e), the [worst-case risk](goal) is the
supremum, over all models in the class, of that estimator's risk.

If the class is empty, or if the estimator's risk is unbounded over the class, this is zero
by the real-supremum convention; `le_worstCaseRisk` therefore asks for an explicit bound. -/

/-- Given an [estimator class](hyp:E), a [model class](hyp:Θ), and a [real-valued risk for each
estimator-model pair](hyp:risk), the [minimax value](goal) is the infimum, over all estimators
in the class, of their worst-case risks over the model class.

Admissibility is expressed by the choice of the estimator index type, so instantiating it at a
subtype restricts the infimum to the estimators satisfying that subtype's condition.

If there are no admissible estimators this is zero by the real-infimum convention. -/

section Bounds

/-- The risk at any single model in the class is at most the estimator's worst-case risk,
provided that estimator's risk is bounded over the class. -/
theorem le_worstCaseRisk {risk : E → Θ → ℝ} {e : E}
    (hbdd : BddAbove (Set.range (risk e))) (θ : Θ) :

    (h : ∀ θ, risk e θ ≤ c) :
    worstCaseRisk risk e ≤ c :=
  ciSup_le h

/-- **Any admissible estimator is an upper bound.** Exhibiting one estimator and bounding
its worst-case risk bounds the minimax value, which is how achievability half of a minimax
rate is certified. The hypothesis rules out a worst-case risk that decreases without bound
across the estimator family. -/
theorem minimaxValue_le_worstCaseRisk {risk : E → Θ → ℝ}
    (hbdd : BddBelow (Set.range (worstCaseRisk risk))) (e : E) :
    minimaxValue risk ≤ worstCaseRisk risk e :=
  ciInf_le hbdd e

/-- For a nonnegative risk, any admissible estimator is an upper bound on the minimax value
with no further side condition, since zero already bounds the worst-case risks below. -/

    minimaxValue risk ≤ worstCaseRisk risk e :=
  minimaxValue_le_worstCaseRisk (bddBelow_range_worstCaseRisk hr) e

/-- **A bound uniform over admissible estimators is a lower bound.** If every admissible
estimator has worst-case risk at least `c`, the minimax value is at least `c`. This is the
converse half of a minimax rate; it needs at least one admissible estimator to exist,
since otherwise the minimax value is zero by convention. -/

    (h : ∀ e, c ≤ worstCaseRisk risk e) :
    c ≤ minimaxValue risk :=

/-- **Two-point reduction to the minimax value.** Fix two models `θ₀` and `θ₁` from the
parameter class. If [every estimator's risk is bounded above across the parameter
class](hyp:hbdd) and [for each estimator, the larger of its risks at the two fixed models
is at least `c`](hyp:htwo), then [the minimax value of the problem is at least `c`](goal).

This is the step that turns a Le Cam or divergence-based testing bound, which produces
exactly such a two-model statement, into a statement about the minimax value. Each
estimator's risk must be bounded over the class for its supremum to be meaningful. -/

section Restriction

/-- Comparing two model classes at a fixed estimator: if every model of the first class is
matched, through the map, by a model of the second class whose risk is at least as large,
the worst-case risk over the first class is at most that over the second. The second class
must bound the estimator's risk, and the first must be nonempty; see
`worstCaseRisk_mono_class_of_nonneg` for the version that drops the nonemptiness. -/

/-- Version of `worstCaseRisk_mono_class` for a nonnegative larger risk: no nonemptiness
assumption on the smaller class is needed, because an empty class contributes worst-case
risk zero, which the larger nonnegative worst-case risk already dominates. -/

/-- **Comparison of two minimax problems.** If every admissible estimator of the second
problem is matched by an estimator of the first whose worst-case risk is no larger, the
first minimax value is at most the second. Both restricting the model class and enlarging
the estimator family are instances; the boundedness hypothesis is on the first problem's
worst-case risks, and the second problem must have at least one estimator. -/
theorem minimaxValue_le_minimaxValue [Nonempty E'] {risk : E → Θ → ℝ} {risk' : E' → Θ' → ℝ}

  refine le_minimaxValue fun e' => ?_
  obtain ⟨e, he⟩ := h e'
  exact (minimaxValue_le_worstCaseRisk hbdd e).trans he

/-- **Restricting the model class cannot raise the minimax value.** If each model of the
smaller class sits, through the map, inside the larger class with no larger risk, then the
minimax value over the smaller class is at most the minimax value over the larger one — the
same estimators face a weaker adversary. This is the standard step that transfers a
published converse proved on a convenient subclass to the full class. -/
theorem minimaxValue_mono_class [Nonempty E] [Nonempty Θ] {risk : E → Θ → ℝ}

    minimaxValue risk ≤ minimaxValue risk' :=
  minimaxValue_le_minimaxValue hbddBelow
    fun e => ⟨e, worstCaseRisk_mono_class φ (hbdd e) (hle e)⟩

/-- For a map `φ` embedding the parameter class of the first problem into that of the
second, if [the first problem's risk is nonnegative](hyp:hr), [the second problem's risk is
nonnegative](hyp:hr'), [each estimator's risk is bounded above across the second parameter
class](hyp:hbdd), and [the first risk at any model is dominated by the second risk at that
model's image under `φ`](hyp:hle), then [the minimax value of the first problem is at most
that of the second](goal).

Version of `minimaxValue_mono_class` for nonnegative risks. Nonnegativity supplies both
the lower bound on the smaller problem's worst-case risks and the empty-class case, so the
only remaining side condition is that each estimator's risk be bounded over the larger
class. Squared-error and absolute-error losses meet the nonnegativity hypotheses by
inspection. -/
