# Structure-agnostic minimax risk packaging

Causal-agnostic specialization of the Le Cam two-point bound
(`Causalean/Stat/Minimax/LeCam.lean`) to a **real-valued functional** `τ` estimated
from `n` i.i.d. samples.  This is the shape consumed by minimax lower bounds for
concrete estimands (e.g. the structure-agnostic ATE optimality theorem, which
lives in the causal `Estimation/` tree, not here).

Main results:

* `real_two_point_lower_bound` — Le Cam specialized to `Θ = ℝ`: under `2s`-separation
  `2s ≤ |θ₀ − θ₁|`, every estimator's worst-case miss probability is `≥ ½(1 − tvDist)`.
* `two_point_lower_bound_of_tvDist_le` — same with an explicit upper bound `c` on `tvDist`.
* `iid_two_point_lower_bound` — the `n`-sample version: the data law is the product
  `Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin n ↦ P)` and the separation is on the functional values
  `τ P₀, τ P₁`.
* `two_point_lower_bound_of_chiSqDiv_le` — the χ²-divergence form obtained from
  `tvDist ≤ ½√χ²`, useful when explicit finite or product χ² computations are
  available.
* `mse_integrable_of_estimator_bound` — bounded-estimator bookkeeping for squared
  losses, used before MSE lower bounds can be applied to truncated estimators.
* `integral_le_sSup_range_of_isProbabilityMeasure` — the Bayes-risk step: the average of a
  risk function against any prior probability measure is at most its worst-case value, so a
  minimax lower bound follows from a lower bound on a single prior's Bayes risk.

These statements remain project-agnostic: concrete causal or nonparametric lower
bounds import this layer after constructing the two laws, the functional
separation, and the required divergence estimate.

/-! # Minimax Risk Lower Bounds

This file specializes Le Cam's two-point method to real-valued statistical
functionals and to estimators based on independent repeated samples. It records
the total-variation, chi-squared-divergence, and bounded-estimator integrability
forms used to certify concrete minimax rates. -/

/-! ## Squared-risk transport through deterministic experiments

These results pull estimators back through deterministic observation rules and transfer
squared-risk lower bounds when the statistical target changes by a nondegenerate affine map.
The final theorem applies the same reduction directly to finite i.i.d. product experiments.
