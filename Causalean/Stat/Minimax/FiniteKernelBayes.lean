# Finite-state Bayes risks through probability kernels

This module supplies a real-valued Bayes-to-minimax bridge for a finite state space. A possibly
continuous prior is mixed through a Markov kernel, and the resulting average loss is bounded by
the finite worst-case loss. It also gives deterministic-map and `FiniteDesign` specializations,
including the finite-sum and measure-integral representations of the mixed risk.
