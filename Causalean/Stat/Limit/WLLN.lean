# Weak law of large numbers for the i.i.d. sample type

Generic weak law of large numbers (WLLN) for `Causalean.Stat.IIDSample`: under
plain integrability, the sample mean of a real-valued statistic converges in
probability to its population integral. The proof converts almost-everywhere
convergence from the strong law to convergence in probability via
`tendstoInMeasure_of_tendsto_ae` on the finite probability space `μ`.

A second-moment corollary specializes the WLLN to `ψ²` for a known influence
function `ψ`, giving consistency of the empirical second moment.

/-! # Weak laws for sample means

This module proves weak laws of large numbers for real-valued statistics of
`IIDSample`.  The measurability helper `IIDSample.measurable_sampleMean` supports
sample means of measurable functions, `IIDSample.sampleMean_tendsto_inProb`
converts the strong law into convergence in probability for any integrable
statistic, and `IIDSample.sampleSecondMoment_tendsto_inProb` records the
second-moment specialization used by variance-estimation arguments. -/

/-- **Generic weak law of large numbers.** For [an i.i.d. sample](hyp:S), suppose a
real-valued statistic `g` is [measurable](hyp:hg_meas) and [integrable under the population law
`P`](hyp:hg_int). Then [the sample mean `S.sampleMean g N` converges in probability to the
population integral `∫ x, g x ∂P` as `N → ∞`](goal).

The proof applies the strong law under plain integrability and then converts
almost-everywhere convergence to convergence in probability. -/
