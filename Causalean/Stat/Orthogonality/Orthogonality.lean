# Neyman orthogonality of moment functionals

The `NeymanOrthogonal` predicate matching `def:est-neyman` in
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation.tex`: a moment functional
`m : H × X × ℝ → ℝ` is Neyman-orthogonal at `(η₀, θ₀)` if (a) the moment
condition `∫ m(η₀, x, θ₀) dP = 0` holds and (b) the Gâteaux derivative of
`η ↦ ∫ m(η, x, θ₀) dP` at `η₀` vanishes in every direction.

The nuisance space `H` is treated abstractly as a real vector space; concrete
instantiations are deferred to the project-specific estimation files
(`Causalean/Estimation/...`).

/-! # Neyman Orthogonality

This file defines Neyman orthogonality for population moment functionals with an
abstract nuisance space. The condition combines the population moment equation
at the target value with the requirement that every nuisance-direction
derivative of the population moment vanishes at the reference nuisance value. -/

/-- Given [an abstract real vector space of nuisance values](hyp:H), [a measurable sample
space](hyp:X), [a real-valued moment function of a nuisance value, an observation, and a target
value](hyp:m), [a reference nuisance value](hyp:η₀), [a target value](hyp:θ₀), and [a population
measure on the sample space](hyp:P), [Neyman orthogonality](goal) means that [the population
moment at the reference nuisance and target values is zero](step:1) and that, for every nuisance
direction, [the population moment along the line from the reference nuisance toward that direction,
divided by the nonzero line parameter, converges to zero as the parameter tends to zero](step:2).

Two conjuncts:

1. **Moment condition.** `∫ m η₀ x θ₀ dP = 0`.
2. **Vanishing Gâteaux derivative.** For every direction `η : H`, the
   one-dimensional curve `t ↦ η₀ + t • (η − η₀)` perturbs the population
   moment only at second order in `t`:
   `lim_{t → 0, t ≠ 0} (∫ m (η₀ + t • (η − η₀)) x θ₀ dP) / t = 0`. -/
