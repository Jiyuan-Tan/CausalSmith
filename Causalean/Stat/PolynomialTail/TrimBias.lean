# General bias bound for the leftover trimming weight

The trimming weight `wλ = 1 − U/(max U λ) ∈ [0,1]` vanishes on `{U ≥ λ}` and is
therefore supported on the small set `{U < λ}` (mass `≤ cp · λᵏ` under `PolyTail`).
Coupling this with a Hölder envelope `|g| ≤ Cβ · λ^β` on `{U < λ}` gives the general
*bias* bound

    | ∫ wλ · g ∂P |  ≤  Cβ · cp · λ^{κ+β},

for any measurable `g` obeying that envelope.  It is a product of "tail mass ×
envelope", proved elementarily (no layer cake).

# Bias from trimming the lower tail

This module bounds the contribution left by the trimming weight
`trimWeight U lam = 1 - U / (max U lam)`.  Since this weight is between `0` and `1` and vanishes
off `{omega | U omega < lam}`, any integrand `g` whose absolute value is bounded by
`Cbeta * lam^beta` on the trimmed set has integrated bias controlled by the lower-tail mass.

The main theorem `trimWeight_bias_bound` proves
`|int trimWeight U lam * g dP| <= Cbeta * cp * lam^(kappa + beta)` under `PolyTail`, `TailSetup`,
and `0 < lam <= t0`.  It is the elementary "tail mass times local envelope" companion to the
layer-cake inverse-moment bounds.

/-- **General trimming-bias bound.** Under [the polynomial lower-tail hypothesis
`PolyTail P U κ t₀ cm cp`](hyp:h) with [`U` measurable and almost surely in
`(0,1]`](hyp:hsetup), fix [a threshold `λ` that is positive](hyp:hlam_pos) and [at most the
window endpoint `t₀`](hyp:hlam_le). If [the envelope constant `Cβ` is nonnegative](hyp:hCβ),
[`g` is measurable](hyp:hg_meas), and [`g` obeys the Hölder envelope `|g| ≤ Cβ · λ^β` on the
event `{U < λ}`](hyp:hg_bd), then [the integrated bias `|∫ wλ · g dP|` is at most
`Cβ · cp · λ^{κ+β}`](goal):

    `| ∫ wλ · g ∂P | ≤ Cβ · cp · λ^{κ+β}`.

The proof bounds `|wλ · g|` a.e. by `Cβ·λ^β · 𝟙{U<λ}` (using `wλ ∈ [0,1]` and `wλ = 0`
off `{U < λ}`) and integrates, picking up the tail mass `P{U < λ} ≤ cp·λᵏ`. -/
