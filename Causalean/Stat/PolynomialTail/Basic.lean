# Polynomial lower-tail moments: setup, integrands, and basic facts

Real-analysis infrastructure for the small-value (lower-tail) asymptotics of a
bounded positive random variable.  Fix a probability measure `P` and a measurable
`U : Ω → ℝ` with `0 < U ≤ 1` almost surely.  The polynomial lower-tail hypothesis
`PolyTail P U κ t₀ cm cp` pins the lower CDF to a power law near zero:

    ∀ t ∈ (0, t₀],  cm · tᵏ ≤ P{U ≤ t} ≤ cp · tᵏ.

The two truncated inverse moments studied downstream are

    I P U λ  =  ∫ U / (max U λ)²            ( = 1/U on {U ≥ λ}, = U/λ² on {U < λ} )
    J P U λ  =  ∫ (max U λ)⁻¹               ( = 1/U on {U ≥ λ}, = 1/λ  on {U < λ} )

together with the leftover trimming weight `wλ = 1 − U/(max U λ) ∈ [0,1]`, supported
on `{U < λ}`.

This file provides the foundation: the `PolyTail` structure, the three definitions,
measurability of the integrands, the elementary mass bound `P{U < λ} ≤ cp λᵏ`, and
integrability of the bounded integrands.  The three-regime downstream bounds live in
`Stat/PolynomialTail/TailIntegralBounds.lean`,
`Stat/PolynomialTail/MomentJBounds.lean`, and `Stat/PolynomialTail/MomentIBounds.lean`.

# Polynomial lower-tail setup

This module defines the reusable setup for polynomial lower-tail calculations.  The structure
`PolyTail P U kappa t0 cm cp` states that the lower CDF of a positive `[0,1]`-valued variable
`U` is squeezed between `cm * t ^ kappa` and `cp * t ^ kappa` on `(0, t0]`; `TailSetup P U`
records the measurability and almost-sure bounds `0 < U <= 1`.

The main integrands are the truncated denominator `truncDen U lam`, the inverse second moment
`invMomentI P U lam = int U / (max U lam)^2`, the inverse first moment
`invMomentJ P U lam = int (max U lam)^(-1)`, and the trimming weight
`trimWeight U lam = 1 - U / (max U lam)`.  The file proves their measurability, elementary
pointwise bounds, the open lower-level-set mass bound `measureReal_lt_le`, and bounded
integrability lemmas used by the layer-cake and regime-bound modules.

/-! ## The polynomial-tail hypothesis -/

/-- **Polynomial lower tail.** For a measurable `[0,1]`-valued function `U`, says that [the lower
CDF `t ↦ P{U ≤ t}` is squeezed between `cm·tᵏ` and `cp·tᵏ`](hyp:tail_lower,tail_upper) on the
window `(0, t₀]`, with [a positive exponent `κ`](hyp:kappa_pos), [a window endpoint `t₀` strictly
between `0` and `1`](hyp:t0_pos,t0_lt_one), and [constants with `0 < cm <
cp`](hyp:cm_pos,cm_lt_cp). This is the sole distributional input to the inverse-moment
asymptotics. -/

/-! ## The tail setup -/

/-- **Tail setup.** Bundles the structural hypotheses on `U`: [measurability](hyp:measurable)
and [`0 < U ≤ 1` almost surely](hyp:pos,le_one). `IsProbabilityMeasure P` is required separately
as a typeclass on the theorems that need it. -/

/-! ## The three definitions -/

/-- For [a sample space](hyp:Ω), [a real-valued variable on that space](hyp:U), [a real threshold](hyp:lam),
and [a sample point](hyp:ω), the [truncated denominator](goal) is the larger of the variable's
value at that point and the threshold. -/
noncomputable def truncDen (U : Ω → ℝ) (lam : ℝ) (ω : Ω) : ℝ := max (U ω) lam

/-- For [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω), [a measure on that space](hyp:P), [a real-valued
variable](hyp:U), and [a real threshold](hyp:lam), the [truncated inverse second moment](goal) is
the integral of the variable divided by the square of the larger of its value and the threshold.

It equals `1/U` on `{U ≥ λ}` and `U/λ²` on `{U < λ}`. -/

  ∫ ω, U ω / (max (U ω) lam) ^ 2 ∂P

/-- For [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω), [a measure on that space](hyp:P), [a real-valued
variable](hyp:U), and [a real threshold](hyp:lam), the [truncated inverse first moment](goal) is
the integral of the reciprocal of the larger of the variable's value and the threshold.

It equals `1/U` on `{U ≥ λ}` and `1/λ` on `{U < λ}`. -/

and [a sample point](hyp:ω), the [trimming weight](goal) is one minus the variable's value divided
by the larger of that value and the threshold.

It is the leftover trimming weight `wλ ω = 1 − U/(max U λ) ∈ [0,1]`, supported on `{U < λ}`. -/
