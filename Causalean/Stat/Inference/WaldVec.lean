# Multivariate Wald / confidence-ellipsoid coverage

The vector analogue of the scalar Wald-coverage theorem
`Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage` (`Causalean/Stat/Inference/Studentize.lean`).

For a multivariate estimator the Wald statistic is the quadratic form
`Wₙ = (√n (θ̂ₙ − θ₀))ᵀ Σ̂ₙ⁻¹ (√n (θ̂ₙ − θ₀))`, an `ℝ`-valued random variable.
A confidence *ellipsoid* `{θ : Wald(θ) ≤ c}` has asymptotic coverage
`χ(Iic c)` where `χ` is the limit law of `Wₙ` — the `χ²_d` distribution when
the rescaled estimator is asymptotically `N(0, Σ)` and `Σ̂ₙ →ₚ Σ` (so that
`Σ̂ₙ⁻¹` whitens the Gaussian into a standard one whose squared norm is `χ²_d`).

Because `Wₙ` is already scalar, the coverage statement reduces to the
one-sided portmanteau on `Set.Iic c` (`Tendsto_dist.tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier`),
exactly mirroring the scalar `wald_coverage`.  This file provides that
reduction; the *construction* of `Wₙ` from `(θ̂ₙ, Σ̂ₙ)` and the proof that
`Wₙ ⇒ χ` (continuous mapping of the joint limit through `(t, S) ↦ tᵀS⁻¹t`) is
the caller's input — just as the scalar `wald_coverage` takes `Sₙ ⇒ N(0,1)` as
a hypothesis rather than proving it.

## On the χ² closed form

Identifying the limit `χ` as the `χ²_d` distribution (and hence reading off the
critical value `c = χ²_{d,1−α}`) requires pushing the *concrete* multivariate
Gaussian limit (`Causalean/Stat/CLT/GaussianLimit.lean`, `gaussianLimit`) through the
quadratic form `S ↦ Sᵀ Σ⁻¹ S` and recognising the result as `χ²_d`.  This step
is now **closed** in `Causalean/Stat/Inference/ChiSquaredWald.lean`
(`gaussianLimit_waldForm_map`): under a non-degenerate asymptotic variance the
whitened quadratic form has the χ²_d law `chiSqDist (finrank E)`
(`Causalean/Stat/CLT/ChiSquared.lean`), and `Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage_chiSq`
specialises the coverage theorem below to that limit.  We still keep `χ` abstract
*here* so that the reduction holds against an arbitrary limit law of `Wₙ`.

Key declarations:

* `Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage_Iic` : one-sided/ellipsoid coverage for a scalar
  statistic `Wₙ ⇒ χ` with `χ` null on the boundary `{c}`.
* `Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage_Iic_of_noAtoms` : the boundary-null hypothesis is
  automatic when the limit law `χ` has no atoms (e.g. any non-degenerate `χ²`).

This file reduces multivariate Wald ellipsoid coverage to scalar convergence of
the Wald statistic.  The theorem `Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage_Iic` says that if
`Wn ⇒ χ`, the limit has zero mass on the boundary of `Iic c`, and a coverage
sequence is asymptotically equivalent to the event `{ω | Wn n ω ≤ c}`, then the
coverage sequence converges to `χ (Iic c)`.

The variant `Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage_Iic_of_noAtoms` discharges the
boundary-null hypothesis when the Wald-statistic limit law has no atoms.  The
chi-squared specialization lives in `Causalean.Stat.Inference.ChiSquaredWald`,
which identifies the Gaussian quadratic-form limit.

/-! ## One-sided Wald / ellipsoid coverage -/

/-- **Wald / confidence-ellipsoid asymptotic coverage.**
Suppose [the scalar Wald statistic sequence `Wₙ` is measurable at every sample size](hyp:hWn)
and [converges in distribution to a limit law `χ`](hyp:hW), and that [`χ` gives zero mass to the
boundary `frontier (Iic c) = {c}`](hyp:hfront). If [a real sequence `coverProb` is asymptotically
equivalent to the ellipsoid event `{ω | Wₙ ω ≤ c}`](hyp:h_bridge), then [`coverProb` converges
to `χ(Iic c)`](goal).

For `Wₙ = (√n(θ̂ₙ−θ₀))ᵀ Σ̂ₙ⁻¹ (√n(θ̂ₙ−θ₀)) ⇒ χ²_d` and `c = χ²_{d,1−α}` this is
the `1 − α` asymptotic coverage of the Wald confidence ellipsoid.  Reduces the
ellipsoid event to the one-sided portmanteau on `Set.Iic c`; vector analogue of
`Tendsto_dist.wald_coverage`. -/
