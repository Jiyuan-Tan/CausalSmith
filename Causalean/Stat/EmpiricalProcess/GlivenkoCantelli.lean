# Glivenko–Cantelli: uniform laws of large numbers

Two sufficient conditions for the weak Glivenko–Cantelli property
`WeakGlivenkoCantelli S f` of a function class `f : ι → X → ℝ` under an
`Causalean.Stat.IIDSample`:

* `glivenkoCantelli_of_fintype` — a **finite** class of integrable functions is
  Glivenko–Cantelli.  Immediate from the pointwise weak law of large numbers
  (`IIDSample.sampleMean_tendsto_inProb`) and a union bound.

* `glivenkoCantelli_of_hasL1Bracketing` — a class with finite `L¹(P)` brackets
  of arbitrarily small width is Glivenko-Cantelli.  The bracketing argument:
  each member is sandwiched on a common full-measure support in a bracket whose
  absolute endpoint gap has integral `≤ ε/2`, so outside the null event that a
  sample point leaves the support, its empirical deviation is controlled by the
  deviations of the finitely many bracket endpoints plus `ε/2`; the endpoint
  deviations vanish by the finite case.

This is the uniform-convergence engine consumed by
`MEstimatorConsistency.lean` for separated-maximum extremum-estimator
consistency.

This file proves two weak Glivenko-Cantelli uniform laws for the predicate defined in
`EmpiricalProcess/Basic.lean`.  The theorem `glivenkoCantelli_of_fintype`
handles finite integrable classes by a union bound and the weak law of large
numbers, while `glivenkoCantelli_of_hasL1Bracketing` upgrades finite
`L¹(P)`-bracketing numbers into a uniform law over an arbitrary indexed class.
The unqualified name Glivenko–Cantelli is reserved for the almost-sure property,
which is not yet formalized here.

between the empirical mean and the population mean of `f i`, taken over all indices `i`,
converges to zero in probability as the sample size grows](goal).

Proof: union bound over the finitely many coordinates, each
vanishing by the weak law of large numbers. -/

/-! ## Bracketing Glivenko–Cantelli -/

/-- **A class with finite `L¹(P)` brackets of arbitrarily small width is
Glivenko-Cantelli.** Consider a family of real-valued functions `f i` on the sample space,
observed along an i.i.d. sample `S` drawn from a probability distribution `P`. If
[every `f i` is measurable](hyp:hmeas) and [for every target width the family can be
covered by finitely many upper/lower bracket pairs, each integrable and each sandwiching
its assigned member almost everywhere with `L¹(P)`-gap between the bracket endpoints at
most that width](hyp:hbr), then [the worst-case gap between the empirical mean and the
population mean of `f i`, taken over all indices `i`, converges to zero in probability as
the sample size grows](goal).

Given `ε > 0`, take a finite `ε/2` bracketing in the sense of `HasL1Bracketing`.
Each class member `f i` lies in a bracket `[lo j, hi j]` on a common full-measure
support, and each bracket has absolute `L¹(P)` width `∫ |hi_j − lo_j| dP ≤ ε/2`.
On sample paths whose observations stay inside the support, the sandwiching gives

    Pₙ lo_j ≤ Pₙ f_i ≤ Pₙ hi_j,    ∫ lo_j ≤ ∫ f_i ≤ ∫ hi_j,

so `|Pₙ f_i − P f_i| ≤ max(|Pₙ hi_j − P hi_j|, |Pₙ lo_j − P lo_j|) + ε/2`.
The exceptional event where some sampled observation leaves the support has
probability zero, and the remaining bad event is contained in the union of the
`2m` endpoint-deviation events, each of which vanishes by the finite case. -/
