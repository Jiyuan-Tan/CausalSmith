# Scalar Frisch–Waugh–Lovell from the normal equations

The single-regressor (`K = 1`) specialization of the FWL identity, stated in
**normal-equation form** rather than as a joint minimization.  Given a weighted
support `c`, a nuisance subspace `H`, a scalar regressor `X` and response `Y`,
if `(β, α)` with `α ∈ H` satisfies the two weighted normal equations

    ⟨Y − β·X − α, X⟩_ω = 0,
    ⟨Y − β·X − α, h⟩_ω = 0   for every h ∈ H,

and the residualized regressor has positive weighted energy
`⟨X̃, X̃⟩_ω > 0`, then

    β = ⟨X̃, Y⟩_ω / ⟨X̃, X̃⟩_ω,   where  X̃ = c.tildeX H X.

This is the finite weighted-support counterpart of the measure-theoretic
population FWL `Causalean.Panel.residualizedCoefficient_eq_of_normalEqs`. It
bridges the normal-equation inputs that estimand arguments naturally produce to
the residualized-coefficient ratio, without going through the joint-minimization
form of `fwl_identity`.

/-! # Scalar Frisch-Waugh-Lovell from normal equations

This file proves the single-regressor finite weighted-support
Frisch-Waugh-Lovell formula from weighted normal equations. The supporting lemma
`ip_tildeX_self` identifies the residualized regressor's inner product with the
original regressor and with itself. The main theorem
`scalar_fwl_of_normalEqs` states that any scalar coefficient satisfying the
regressor and nuisance normal equations equals the residualized coefficient
ratio.

The result supplies the normal-equation form needed by downstream
estimand-characterization arguments without requiring them to restate a joint
least-squares minimization problem. -/

/-- **Scalar FWL from the normal equations.** Suppose [the nuisance term `α` lies in
`H`](hyp:hα), [the `H`-residualized regressor `X̃` has nonzero weighted
self-inner-product](hyp:hden), and the coefficient `β` with nuisance term `α` satisfies
[the weighted normal equation against the raw regressor `X`](hyp:h_normal_X) and [the
weighted normal equation against every element of the nuisance space `H`](hyp:h_normal_H).
Then [`β` equals the residualized coefficient ratio `⟨X̃, Y⟩_ω / ⟨X̃, X̃⟩_ω`](goal). -/
