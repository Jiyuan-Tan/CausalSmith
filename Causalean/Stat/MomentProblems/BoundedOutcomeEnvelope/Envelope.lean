# Bounded-outcome residual envelope: `IsLUB`

This file assembles the bounded-outcome moment problem. For `v ∈ (0,1)`, the measure-level residual
envelope `ρ(v) = rhoEnvelope v` is the least upper bound of the residual `l2ResidualQuadratic μ`
over all admissible laws `μ` (probability measures on `[0,1]` with second moment `v²`), and it is
*attained* by the extremal three-point law.

* `rho_envelope_isLUB` — `IsLUB (residualSet v) (rhoEnvelope v)`.
* `rho_envelope_attained` — the extremal law realizing `ρ(v)` (re-exported from `Attainment`).
* `interior_quartic_unique_root` — the unique interior root of the FOC quartic (from `QuarticRoot`).

The `IsLUB` combines the upper bound `l2ResidualQuadratic_le_rho` (every admissible residual is
`≤ ρ(v)`) with attainment (`ρ(v)` itself is a realized residual), so any upper bound of the set is
`≥ ρ(v)`.

/-- **Measure-level sharp envelope (`IsLUB`).** For [`v` strictly between `0` and `1`](hyp:hv0,hv1),
[`rhoEnvelope v` is the least upper bound of the set of residuals `l2ResidualQuadratic μ` over
admissible laws `μ`](goal).  Equivalently: the sup over all probability measures on `[0,1]` with
`∫ y² ∂μ = v²` of the `L²` residual of `y²` on `span{1, y}` equals the closed form `ρ(v)`, and is
attained (by the extremal three-point law). -/
