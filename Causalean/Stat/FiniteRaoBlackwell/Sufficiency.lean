# Finite factorization sufficiency

This module gives a finite Fisher--Neyman factorization criterion for the statistic of a
`FiniteUniformExperiment`.  A state-dependent factor through the statistic and a nonnegative
state-independent carrier weight determine a common conditional distribution of the full data
given the statistic.  Null carrier fibers are totalized by the experiment's fallback point.
