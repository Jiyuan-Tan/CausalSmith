# Invariant Causal Prediction — regression-invariance null and identified set

The observable layer of the linear-Gaussian ICP problem: the regression
predictor in each environment, the **regression-invariance null** `H_{0,S}`, and
the **identified set** `S(E)` (Peters–Bühlmann–Meinshausen 2016, `eq:betapred`,
`eq:H0Sregr`, `eq:ident`).

## Encoding choices (fidelity notes)

* **Residual.**  `residual γ env ω := Yᵉ(ω) − Σ_k γ k · Xₖᵉ(ω)` with the sum over
  all coordinates (`γ` is supported on `S`, so `k ∉ S` contributes nothing).
  This is `R^e(S)` of the paper (`R^e = Y^e − X^e β`).

* **Support on `S`.**  "`γ` supported on `S`" is `∀ k, γ k ≠ 0 → k ∈ S`
  (`SupportedOn`).  This is the paper's constraint `β_k = 0 if k ∉ S`.

* **Regression-invariance null `H_{0,S}`.** This file uses a pairwise-coordinate
  version of the regression null: there exist a coefficient vector `γ`
  supported on `S` and a fixed residual law `Fε` such that for **every**
  environment `e`, the residual `R^e = Y^e − Σ γ_k X_k^e` is (i) independent of
  each predictor coordinate in `S` and (ii) has law `Fε` (the *same* law across
  environments).  In this jointly Gaussian linear-Gaussian setting,
  coordinatewise independence of the residual from each `X_k`, `k ∈ S`, is
  equivalent to joint independence from the vector `X_S`, so this matches the
  Peters-Buhlmann-Meinshausen regression null despite the weaker-looking form.
  The paper also requires `γ = β^{pred,e}(S)` (the
  population-OLS coefficient); under independence of `R^e` from `X_S^e` that is
  automatic (the residual is orthogonal to `X_S`, i.e. the normal equations
  hold), so we fold it into the independence clause and do not carry `β^{pred}`
  as a separate object.  The **observational**
  environment `obs` is included as one of the environments (it is `e = 1`), so
  invariance is genuinely across the whole family.

* **Residual law as a measure on `ℝ`.**  `Fε : Measure ℝ`; "`R^e ∼ Fε`" is
  `Pᵉ.map (residual γ (env e)) = Fε`.  Equivalently `IdentDistrib` across
  environments; we phrase it via a single shared measure so the "same law" is one
  object.  The mean-shift proof only needs that the two laws differ, which a
  shared-measure formulation exposes directly (`hLawObs`, `hLawEnv`).

* **Identified set `S(E)` (`eq:ident`).**  `S(E) := ⋂ {S : H_{0,S} holds}`.
  We encode the intersection over the (finite) powerset of predictors that
  satisfy the null.

vector is supported on that set](goal) means that every nonzero coefficient has an index in the
set.

model's exogenous variables](hyp:ω), [the observational regression residual](goal) is the target
value minus the sum of each coordinate value multiplied by its coefficient.

The regression residual in the observational SEM:

/-- For [a model with p predictor coordinates and one target coordinate](hyp:p), [a linear-Gaussian
environment family](hyp:F), and [a predictor set](hyp:S), [the regression-invariance null](goal)
means that there exist a coefficient vector supported on that set and one residual measure
such that (1) [the coefficient vector is supported on the predictor set](step:1), (2) [in the
observational environment the residual is independent of each selected predictor](step:2), (3) [its
observational residual law is the common law](step:3), (4) [in every interventional environment the
residual is independent of each selected predictor](step:4), and (5) every interventional residual
law is the same common law.

**Pairwise regression-invariance null.**

There exist a coefficient vector `γ` supported on `S` and a single residual law
`Fε : Measure ℝ` such that, in *every* environment of the family (observational
and interventional), the residual `R = Y − Σ γ_k X_k`

* is independent of every predictor coordinate in `S`, and
* has law `Fε` (the same distribution across environments).

In this jointly Gaussian linear-Gaussian setting, coordinatewise independence
of the residual from each `X_k`, `k ∈ S`, is equivalent to joint independence
from the vector `X_S`, so this matches the Peters-Buhlmann-Meinshausen
regression null despite the weaker-looking form. `S(E)` is the intersection of
all `S` for which it holds. -/

whether each predictor set satisfies the regression-invariance null](goal) is [supplied by

Decidability of the invariance null, needed for the `filter` in

The **identified set** `S(E) := ⋂ {S : H_{0,S} holds}` (`eq:ident`).

Encoded as the intersection over all predictor subsets satisfying the invariance
null.  If no set satisfies the null the convention `⋂ ∅ = univ` is harmless,
because under the theorem's hypotheses `PA(Y)` itself always satisfies the null
(soundness), so the index set is nonempty. -/
