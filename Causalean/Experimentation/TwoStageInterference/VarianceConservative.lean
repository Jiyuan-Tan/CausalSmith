# Hudgens–Halloran (2008): conservative within-group variance estimator

The natural design-based estimator of the difference-in-means variance from a single realized
within-group assignment.  Among the units observed treated it forms the sample variance of their
outcomes, among the units observed in control it forms the sample variance of theirs, and it
combines them as `Ŝ₁/K + Ŝ₀/(n−K)` — the empirical analogue of the first two terms of the Neyman
variance `S₁/K + S₀/(n−K) − Sτ/n`.  Because it excludes the unestimable unit-effect term `Sτ/n`
(nonnegative), the estimator is conservative in expectation.  This file defines the estimator,
proves that it is pointwise nonnegative, and proves the conservativeness statement
`Var(τ̂) ≤ E[v̂ar]` (Hudgens–Halloran Eq. 9): in expectation `E[v̂ar] = S₁/K + S₀/(n−K)`, which
overstates the Neyman variance by exactly the nonnegative unit-effect term `Sτ/n`.

The conservativeness theorem instantiates the generic expected-sample-variance moment lemma
`E_Shat` (in `VarianceMoments`) for the treated indicators (count `K`) and the control indicators
`1 − T` (count `n − K`), so `E[Ŝ₁] = S₁` and `E[Ŝ₀] = S₀`.  Beyond the hypotheses of the variance
identity `Var_tauHat` it needs two faithful features of the completely-randomized design: a
deterministic treated count `∑ⱼ Tⱼ = K` on the design's support (`hsupp`, needed to expand the
sample variance without third moments), and the non-degeneracy bounds `2 ≤ K` and `K + 2 ≤ n`
(needed so both sample variances exist, i.e. `K−1`, `n−K−1`, `n−1` are all nonzero).

/-! # Conservative two-stage variance estimators

Within-group sample-variance estimators conservatively estimate direct-effect
randomization variance.

The definitions `obsMeanTreated`, `obsMeanControl`, `ShatTreated`, `ShatControl`, and `varHat`
describe the single-assignment sample-variance estimator.  The theorem `varHat_nonneg` proves
pointwise nonnegativity, `E_ShatTreated` and `E_ShatControl` identify the expected treated and
control sample variances with `S1` and `S0`, and `E_varHat_conservative` proves
`Var(tauHat) ≤ E[varHat]`.  `E_varHat_conservative_CRD` specializes that inequality to the
completely randomized within-group design, where the moment and support hypotheses are proved by
`crd_mean`, `crd_pair`, and `crd_supp`.
