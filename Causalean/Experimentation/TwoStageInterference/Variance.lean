# Hudgens–Halloran (2008), Theorem 5: within-group difference-in-means variance

The variance of the within-group difference-in-means estimator of a treatment effect, under a
completely randomized experiment that always treats exactly `K` of the `n` units in the group.
Under stratified interference (Hudgens & Halloran's Assumption 2) each unit's outcome on the
design's support takes only two values — one when the unit is treated (so `K−1` others are
treated) and one when it is untreated (so `K` others are treated) — so the estimator is a linear
function of the treatment indicators and its randomization variance is the classical Neyman
completely-randomized-experiment variance.  Writing `S₁` and `S₀` for the population variances of
the treated-state and untreated-state outcomes (with `n−1` in the denominator) and `Sτ` for the
population variance of the unit-level treatment effects, the variance of the difference-in-means
estimator equals `S₁/K + S₀/(n−K) − Sτ/n`.  The generic identity (`Var_tauHat`) is stated for *any*
within-group design whose treatment indicators satisfy the first- and second-order moment
hypotheses; the completely randomized (mixed) design of Assumption 1 is the canonical such design,
and `Var_tauHat_CRD` specializes the identity to it — with the moments discharged from the design
(`crd_mean`/`crd_pair`) rather than assumed.  This file also proves that the natural conservative
variance estimator is pointwise nonnegative.

The two-valued outcomes `a j` (unit `j` when treated) and `b j` (unit `j` when untreated) are
taken as the data; the connection to the stratified-interference factorization
(`exists_strat_factor`) is upstream and not re-threaded here.

# Within-group Neyman variance under complete randomization

This file proves the Hudgens-Halloran within-group difference-in-means variance identity. The
generic theorem states the Neyman split `S₁/K + S₀/(n−K) − Sτ/n` from first- and second-order
treatment-indicator moments, then specializes it to the completely randomized within-group design.

The public definitions are the treatment indicator `T`, the difference-in-means statistic
`tauHat`, the population mean `popMeanV`, and the sample variances `S1`, `S0`, and `Stau`.
`Var_tauHat` is the moment-conditioned theorem; `Var_tauHat_CRD` is the corresponding theorem for
the actual completely randomized design, with `crd_mean` and `crd_pair` supplying the moments.
