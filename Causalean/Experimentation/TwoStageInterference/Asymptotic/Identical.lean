# Liu–Hudgens (2014), Proposition 5.1 under literally identical groups

This file discharges the analytic homogeneity hypothesis `hhom` of the treatment-minus-control
direct-effect CLT bundle `Homogeneous` from a *concrete, checkable* condition: that the groups are
literally identical.  In the identical-groups regime every group has the same size `K`, the same
allocation strategies ψ/φ, the same potential outcomes, and the same unit counts, so the
within-group assignment space is the common, non-dependent space `W := Fin K → Bool` and the
conditional design is a genuine product over `ι → W`.

The mathematical content is selection symmetry.  The conditional studentized CDF given a stage-1
selection `s` depends on `s` only through the number of selected groups (fixed at `C`), because a
coordinate permutation `σ : ι ≃ ι` carrying one selection pattern to another simultaneously relabels
the conditional product design (via `prodDesign_Pr_reindex`) and carries the studentized statistic,
since identical groups make the per-group summand the same for every coordinate.  Hence any two
supported selections give the same conditional CDF, which is exactly `hhom`.

It provides: the identical-groups bundle `IdenticalRef` (reference data per `n` plus the common
propensity hypotheses, assembling a constant `LHExperiment`); the selection-symmetry permutation
existence lemma `exists_equiv_selection`; the derived hypothesis `hhom_of_identical`; the assembled
`Homogeneous` bundle `homogeneous_of_identical`; and the headline `directEffect_clt_identical`, which
rests on identical groups, bounded outcomes, and the many-groups rate — no `hhom` assumption.

# Identical-groups discharge for the direct-effect CLT

This file turns literal group-level symmetry into the homogeneity hypothesis used by the
Liu-Hudgens direct-effect CLT.

The reference bundle `IdenticalRef` stores one identical-groups experiment: a common group size,
common within-group strategies, common potential outcomes, common treated/control counts, the
stage-1 design, and the propensities/nondegeneracy hypotheses needed to build `toExp :
LHExperiment`. It also defines the common per-group contrast `groupDiff₀`, the concrete
studentized statistic `studId`, the common group effect `refDelta`, and the common within-group
variance `refVar`.

The theorem `hhom_of_identical` proves the selection-symmetry hypothesis by relabeling equal-size
selected sets with `exists_equiv_selection` and `prodDesign_Pr_reindex`. The definition
`homogeneous_of_identical` assembles the resulting `Homogeneous` bundle, and
`directEffect_clt_identical` derives asymptotic normality without assuming analytic homogeneity as a
separate premise.
