# Liu–Hudgens (2014): large-sample setup for the direct-effect contrast

This file packages a single two-stage Hudgens–Halloran experiment into a self-contained
bundle `LHExperiment`, so that a *sequence* of such experiments (groups → ∞) can be studied for
large-sample inference following Liu & Hudgens (2014).  Each bundle carries the population of
groups `ι`, the per-group size `gsize i`, the two-stage design (stage-1 strategy design `D₁` and
the within-group strategy designs `ψ`/`φ`), the partial-interference potential outcomes `Y`, the
control/treatment unit counts `m0`/`m1`, the number `C` of ψ-selected groups, and — crucially —
the *known* design propensities (within-group control/treatment propensities `m0 i / nᵢ`,
`m1 i / nᵢ`, the stage-1 first-order propensity `C/N`, and the stage-1 pair propensity
`C(C−1)/(N(N−1))`) as carried regularity hypotheses.  These are exactly the hypotheses of the
unbiasedness theorem `E_estDirect` and the variance theorem `Var_estDirect`, so the bundle exposes
two reusable bridges, `E_estD` (the estimator is unbiased for the population average
treatment-minus-control direct-effect contrast) and `var_estD` (its design variance equals the
closed-form two-stage variance `directVar`), simply by feeding the carried hypotheses to those
theorems.

/-! # Liu-Hudgens asymptotic setup

`LHExperiment` packages one Hudgens-Halloran two-stage experiment for Liu-Hudgens large-sample
inference on the treatment-minus-control direct-effect contrast.

The structure carries the group population, group sizes, stage-1 strategy design, within-group
strategies `ψ` and `φ`, partial-interference potential outcomes, fixed treated/control counts,
the number `C` of `ψ`-selected groups, and the known design propensities needed by the finite-sample
unbiasedness and variance theorems. Its namespace defines the joint two-stage design `jointD`, the
Horvitz-Thompson direct-effect estimator `estD`, the estimand `DEbar`, and the closed-form variance
`directVar`.

The main theorems are the reusable bridges `E_estD` and `var_estD`: they specialize the
finite-sample Hudgens-Halloran unbiasedness and variance results to each packaged experiment, so
later consistency, CLT, and Wald arguments can reason through `LHExperiment` alone.

/-- A single Liu–Hudgens (2014) two-stage experiment, packaged so that a sequence of them can be
studied for large-sample inference. Carries [a finite population of groups](hyp:ι) with
[per-group sizes](hyp:gsize), [a stage-1 design assigning each group a strategy](hyp:D₁), the
per-group allocation strategies [ψ](hyp:ψ) and [φ](hyp:φ), [partial-interference potential
outcomes](hyp:Y), and design-fixed [control](hyp:m0) and [treatment](hyp:m1) unit counts per
group, together with the regularity conditions that [the number C of ψ-selected groups is
nonzero](hyp:C,hC), [every group has nonzero control and treatment counts](hyp:hm0,hm1) and
[nonzero size](hyp:hn), [the population has at least one group](hyp:hN) and [at least two
groups](hyp:hN1), [every unit's within-group control propensity equals m0 i / nᵢ](hyp:hprop0)
and [its treatment propensity equals m1 i / nᵢ](hyp:hprop1), [every group's stage-1 selection
propensity equals C/N](hyp:hstage1), and [every pair's joint selection propensity equals
C(C−1)/(N(N−1))](hyp:hstage1pair) — exactly the hypothesis lists of `E_estDirect` and
`Var_estDirect`. -/
