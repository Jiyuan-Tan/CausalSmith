# Hudgens–Halloran (2008): Assumption 2 (stratified interference)

Within Hudgens & Halloran's partial-interference setup, **stratified interference**
(their Assumption 2) restricts how a unit's outcome can depend on the rest of its group.
A unit `(i,j)`'s outcome is allowed to depend on the within-group assignment `w` only
through two summaries: the unit's *own* treatment `w j`, and the *number of other units in
the group that are treated* — not which particular units are treated.  Formally, if two
assignments `w` and `w'` give unit `j` the same own treatment and the same count of treated
others, then unit `(i,j)`'s outcome is the same under `w` and under `w'`.

This file records the stratified exposure summary (own treatment together with the count of
treated others), the stratified-interference predicate, and the resulting factorization: a
population `Y` satisfying stratified interference factors through the exposure, i.e. there is
`g i j : Bool × ℕ → ℝ` with `Y i j w = g i j (stratExpo i j w)`.  This is the instance of
Aronow–Samii's "properly specified exposure mapping" appropriate to grouped interference.

/-! # Stratified interference

Stratified interference factors outcomes through own treatment and the count of treated peers.

The grouped exposure summary is `stratExpo`, built from a unit's own treatment and
`numTreatedOthers`.  `StratifiedInterference` states Hudgens-Halloran Assumption 2 as invariance
under equality of that exposure summary, `StratifiedInterference.elim` exposes the two raw
conditions, and `exists_strat_factor` proves that any stratified-interference outcome function
factors through the exposure map.
