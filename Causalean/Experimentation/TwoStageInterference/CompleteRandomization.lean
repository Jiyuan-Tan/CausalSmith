# The completely randomized (mixed) design on `U → Bool`

Hudgens & Halloran (2008) state their variance results under **mixed** assignment strategies (their
Assumption 1): at each stage a fixed number of units is treated, and every one of the
`(card / count)` treated sets is equally likely.  That is exactly the completely randomized design.
This file transports the abstract completely randomized design `completeRandomization` — defined on
the size-`K` subsets `{S : Finset U // S.card = K}`, with its inclusion probabilities already
proven — onto the assignment space `U → Bool` used by the two-stage estimators, by pushing it
forward along the treated-set-to-indicator-vector map.

The design facts the Neyman/Hudgens–Halloran variance identities consume are then *derived* here,
not assumed: the first-order inclusion probability `E[Tᵢ] = K/N`, the pairwise second-order
inclusion probability `E[Tᵢ Tⱼ] = K(K−1)/(N(N−1))` for `i ≠ j`, the complementary first moment
`E[1−Tᵢ] = (N−K)/N`, and the deterministic treated count `∑ᵢ Tᵢ = K` on the design's support.  The
general `crdOn` engine works for any finite population `U`; `crd` is the within-group specialization
to `U = Fin n` (used by the within-group Theorem 5 / Eq. 9 corollaries), and the stage-1 group
selection uses the same engine with `U = ι` (used by the between-group Theorem 4 / Theorem 6
corollaries).  Downstream headline theorems specialize their generic, moment-conditioned forms to
these designs so that "under the completely randomized design" is a proven statement, not a
hypothesis.

# Completely randomized assignment on Boolean vectors

This file pushes the paper-agnostic complete-randomization design on fixed-size treated sets
forward to the Boolean assignment spaces used by the two-stage interference modules. It proves the
first- and second-order inclusion probabilities and deterministic treated-count support facts
needed to instantiate the Hudgens-Halloran variance theorems under actual complete randomization.

The general construction is `crdOn` for any finite population `U`; `crd` is the within-group
specialization to `Fin n`.  The exported facts `crdOn_mean`, `crdOn_pair`, `crdOn_supp`,
`crd_mean`, `crd_pair`, `crd_supp`, `crd_prop_true`, and `crd_prop_false` are the moment and
propensity lemmas consumed by the unbiasedness and variance files.
