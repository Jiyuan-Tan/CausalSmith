# Design-based (randomization) inference substrate

The shared, paper-agnostic substrate for design-based / randomization inference under
interference: the finite-population, fixed-potential-outcome flavor of the potential-outcomes
framework, where probability comes from the experimenter's randomization over a finite assignment
space `Ω`.  Reused by every experimentation paper under `Causalean/Experimentation/`.

* `DesignCore` — finite randomization design; `FiniteDesign` `E`/`Var`/`Cov` finite-sum algebra.
* `Exposure` — exposure mappings and the generalized probability of exposure.
* `PotentialOutcome` — properly-specified mapping (Cond 1) and consistency (Cond 2); `Yobs`.
* `HT.{Estimator,Unbiased,Variance}` — Horvitz–Thompson total/mean/effect estimators with
  unbiasedness and randomization variance.
* `Chebyshev` — the finite-design Chebyshev inequality (convergence-in-probability engine), plus
  the zero-hitting corollary bounding degeneracy of a nonzero-mean statistic.
* `RatioLinearization` — finite-sample delta-method identities: exact design-mean of normalized
  (Horvitz–Thompson / Hájek) ratios and their products (the ratio linearization kernel).
* `WaldCoverage` — paper-agnostic conservative Wald-interval liminf coverage from a studentized
  CLT plus a dominating deterministic variance estimator.
* `WaldPipeline` — the full pipeline (`dependency_wald_coverage`): chains `DependencyCLT` into
  `WaldCoverage`, so dependency-graph primitives plus a conservative variance give Wald coverage in
  one theorem.
* `EdgeVarianceBound` — abstract `var_edge_sum_le`: variance of an edge-sum over a bounded-degree
  dependency graph (`≤ 8M²m³N`).
* `GaussianCDF` — standard-normal CDF facts (agreement with Mathlib `cdf`, symmetry, continuity).
* `FiniteDesignMeasure` — the `D.toMeasure := ∑ p(z)·δ_z` bridge to measure-theoretic probability
  (`∫=E`, `.real=Pr`, `variance=Var`).
* `MeasureBridge` — the reverse-descent bundle: `E`/`Var`/`Pr`/`Cov` as integral/variance/measure/
  covariance, the `MemLp`/measurability dischargers, Chebyshev re-derived from Mathlib, and the
  covariance Cauchy–Schwarz bound `|Cov| ≤ √Var·√Var`.
* `Concentration` — Bernstein/sub-exponential tail bounds for a bounded design statistic
  (`exp(−ε²/·)`, sharper than Chebyshev), via the measure bridge.
* `DependencyCLT` — the general design-based CLT (`dependency_studentized_cdf`): a bounded-degree
  dependency-graph sum's studentized statistic is asymptotically standard normal under the design,
  by transporting the Stein CLT engine across the measure bridge.  Composes with `WaldCoverage`.
* `CompoundVariance` — law of total variance for the two-stage `compound` design
  (`E_compound_tower`, `Var_compound_eq_tower`): total variance = expected within-stage variance +
  variance of the conditional mean; underlies between-group / within-group decompositions.
* `ProductVariance` — cross-coordinate independence of the `prodDesign`: distinct-coordinate
  functions are uncorrelated (`Cov_prod_apply_of_ne`), so the variance of a linear combination of
  single-coordinate functions is the sum of the coordinate variances (`Var_prod_linear_comb`).
* `ProductReindex` — relabeling a product design over a common coordinate space by a coordinate
  permutation `σ` (`prodDesign_Pr_reindex`): a permuted predicate's probability under
  `prodDesign D` equals the predicate's probability under the permuted product
  `prodDesign (D ∘ σ)`; pure finite-sum reindexing, the kernel for selection-symmetry arguments.
* `ProductMeasure` — the product design's measure IS Mathlib's product measure
  (`prodDesign_toMeasure_eq_pi`), so functions of disjoint coordinate blocks are genuinely
  measure-theoretically independent (`indepFun_prodDesign_eval`, `indepFun_prodDesign_blocks`,
  `indepFun_prodDesign_apply_blocks`) — the bridge feeding the dependency-graph CLT.
* `IndepSummandsCLT` — the independent-summands CLT (`prodDesign_clt`): a normalized sum of
  independent, uniformly bounded, mean-zero per-coordinate summands over a product design converges
  to the standard normal, via the trivial diagonal dependency graph fed into
  `stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph`.
* `Risk` — bias, mean squared error, and the bias–variance decomposition `mse = Var + bias²` for a
  design-based estimator of a fixed target; the `mse`-as-functional-of-the-design that the
  optimality layer minimizes.
* `Optimality` — the design as a chosen parameter: `DesignFamily`, design domination, optimal
  designs (`IsOptimalOn`) with existence over a finite family, and the mean-squared-error risk
  `mseRisk` of a design-indexed estimator.
* `Designs` — the design zoo: canonical Bernoulli, complete-randomization, and stratified designs
  with their first/second-order inclusion probabilities.
* `Optimality.Minimax` — worst-case risk over a family of states, minimax designs, and regret.
* `Optimality.Neyman` — Neyman optimal allocation: the treatment fraction minimizing the two-arm
  variance `A/x + B/(1−x)` is `√A/(√A+√B)`.
* `Estimators` — design-based estimators: the difference-in-means estimator and its unbiasedness.
* `Variance` — conservative variance estimators (`E[V̂] ≥ Var`) and the conservative
  Chebyshev bound.
