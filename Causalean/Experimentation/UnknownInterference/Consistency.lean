# Sävje–Aronow–Hudgens (2021): consistency of Horvitz–Thompson for EATE under unknown interference

The flagship: along a sequence of Bernoulli experiments, the Horvitz–Thompson estimator is
**consistent** for the expected average treatment effect under *restricted interference*
(`d̄ = o(n)`), with no structural knowledge of the interference.  This is the conceptual heart of
the paper — standard estimators remain close to an average treatment effect even when units
interfere in unknown ways, as long as the average amount of interference grows slowly enough.

The argument is Chebyshev on the variance bound `Var(ĤT) ≤ k⁴·d̄/n` (`var_htEst_le`): since HT is
exactly unbiased for EATE (`htEst_unbiased`), `Pr(|ĤT − EATE| ≥ ε) ≤ (k⁴·d̄/n)/ε² → 0` whenever
`k⁴·d̄/n → 0`.  The same bound gives **root-n consistency** when `d̄` is bounded (`n·Var ≤ k⁴·C`).

The `SAHExperiment` bundle packages one Bernoulli experiment with its regularity constant `k`, so a
sequence `ℕ → SAHExperiment` is the paper's growing-sample regime.

/-! # Consistency under unknown interference

Horvitz-Thompson estimates the expected average treatment effect consistently when average
interference is sparse.

This file packages one Sävje-Aronow-Hudgens Bernoulli experiment as `SAHExperiment`, including
the finite unit type, treatment probabilities, potential outcomes, overlap bounds, moment bound,
and regularity constant.  The namespace-level bundle lemmas `D_E_htEst`, `D_Var_htEst_le`, and
`chebyshev_eate` restate exact unbiasedness, the finite-sample variance bound, and the resulting
Chebyshev tail inequality for the packaged experiment.  The main sequence theorem
`htEst_consistent_eate` proves convergence in probability when `k^4 * dbar / n -> 0`, and
`root_n_var` records the root-n variance scaling under bounded average interference.
