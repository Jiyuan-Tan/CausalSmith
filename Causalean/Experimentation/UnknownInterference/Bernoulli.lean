# Sävje–Aronow–Hudgens (2021): the Bernoulli randomization design

The Bernoulli design assigns each unit's treatment by an independent coin flip with unit-specific
probability `p i`.  It is exactly the product design `prodDesign` of the per-unit coin designs, so
cross-unit independence — and, more importantly, independence of two units' outcomes whenever they
are not interference dependent — is the structural disjoint-block independence of the product
design.  This file reuses the canonical coin design, builds the Bernoulli design, and records the
marginal facts (`Z_i ⊥ Z_{-i}`, `E[Z_i] = p_i`) used for Horvitz–Thompson unbiasedness.

/-! # Bernoulli design under unknown interference

Independent Bernoulli assignment supplies the product-design independence used for
Sävje-Aronow-Hudgens unknown-interference results.

This file reuses the canonical single-unit `coinDesign`, builds the product Bernoulli randomization
design `bernoulliDesign`, and proves the one-coordinate marginal identities used throughout the
Horvitz-Thompson and Hájek arguments.  `coinDesign_E` expands the two-point expectation,
`bernoulliDesign_E_eval` reduces any function of one unit's assignment to the corresponding coin
expectation, and `bernoulliDesign_E_treat` / `bernoulliDesign_E_ctrl` give the marginal treatment
and control probabilities `p_i` and `1 - p_i`.

[unit-specific treatment-probability function](hyp:p), and every such function whose [values are
nonnegative](hyp:hp0) and [at most one](hyp:hp1), the [Bernoulli randomization design](goal) is the
probability design on all binary treatment assignments in which each unit is independently treated
with its specified probability.
