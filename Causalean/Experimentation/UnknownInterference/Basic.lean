# Sävje–Aronow–Hudgens (2021): EATE estimand and the Horvitz–Thompson estimator

The setup for "Average treatment effects in the presence of unknown interference"
(Sävje, Aronow & Hudgens, *Annals of Statistics* 49(2), 2021).  A finite sample of units `U`
is assigned a binary treatment vector `z : U → Bool` by a randomization design.  Each unit's
outcome `y i z` may depend on the *entire* assignment `z` — units interfere — but the form of
the interference is unknown.

This file fixes the primitives:

* the **interference indicator** `Interferes y ℓ i` (changing `ℓ`'s treatment changes `i`'s
  outcome under some assignment, plus the reflexive case `ℓ = i`), its symmetric closure
  `InterfDep y i j` (some `ℓ` interferes with both `i` and `j`), and the average interference
  dependence `dbar` (the paper's `d̄`, the basis for the "restricted interference" assumption);
* the **assignment-conditional unit-level effect** `tau y i z = y i (z with iᵗʰ coord 1) −
  y i (z with iᵗʰ coord 0)`, its average `ACATE` (assignment-conditional ATE), and the
  **expected average treatment effect** `EATE = E[ACATE(Z)]` (Definition: the design average of
  the assignment-conditional ATE);
* the **Horvitz–Thompson estimator** `htEst`.

The key structural fact proven here is `y_eq_of_agree_on_interferers`: a unit's outcome depends
only on the treatments of the units that interfere with it — the bridge that turns
"`InterfDep` fails" into "the two HT summands depend on disjoint coordinate blocks", which the
disjoint-block independence lemma then turns into a vanishing covariance.

/-! ### Interference structure -/

/-- For [a population of units](hyp:U), [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), and [two units,
the potential source unit and the affected unit](hyp:ℓ,i), the [interference indicator](goal)
holds exactly when the units are identical or there is an assignment under which reversing the
source unit's treatment changes the affected unit's outcome. -/
def Interferes (y : U → (U → Bool) → ℝ) (ℓ i : U) : Prop :=
  ℓ = i ∨ ∃ z : U → Bool, y i z ≠ y i (Function.update z ℓ (! z ℓ))

/-- For [a population of units](hyp:U), [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), and [two
units](hyp:i,j), the [interference-dependence relation](goal) holds exactly when some unit's
treatment interferes with both units' outcomes; equivalently, the two outcomes may be affected by
a common treatment. -/

  ∃ ℓ : U, Interferes y ℓ i ∧ Interferes y ℓ j

open Classical in
/-- For [a finite population of units](hyp:U) and [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), the
[unnormalized interference-dependence count](goal) is the number of ordered pairs of units that
are interference dependent. -/
noncomputable def dbarCount (y : U → (U → Bool) → ℝ) : ℝ :=
  ∑ i : U, ∑ j : U, if InterfDep y i j then (1 : ℝ) else 0

/-- For [a finite population of units](hyp:U) and [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), the
[average interference dependence](goal) is the unnormalized count of interference-dependent
ordered pairs divided by the population size.  For a nonempty population it equals one under no
interference and the population size when every ordered pair is interference dependent; restricted
interference is the condition that it is of smaller order than the population size. -/

/-! ### Estimand: EATE -/

/-- For [a population of units](hyp:U), [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), [a unit](hyp:i),
and [an assignment of treatments to all units](hyp:z), the [assignment-conditional unit-level
treatment effect](goal) is that unit's outcome when its own treatment is set to treated minus its
outcome when its own treatment is set to control, with every other unit's assignment held fixed. -/
def tau (y : U → (U → Bool) → ℝ) (i : U) (z : U → Bool) : ℝ :=
  y i (Function.update z i true) - y i (Function.update z i false)

/-- For [a finite population of units](hyp:U), [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), and [an
assignment of treatments to all units](hyp:z), the [assignment-conditional average treatment
effect](goal) is the average, over all units, of their own-treatment effects with the remaining
assignments held fixed. -/
noncomputable def ACATE (y : U → (U → Bool) → ℝ) (z : U → Bool) : ℝ :=
  (∑ i : U, tau y i z) / (Fintype.card U : ℝ)

/-- For [a finite population of units](hyp:U), [a randomization design over treatment
assignments](hyp:D), and [a potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), the [expected average treatment
effect](goal) is the design expectation of the assignment-conditional average treatment effect.
Under no interference this quantity equals the conventional average treatment effect because the
assignment-conditional effect is then constant across assignments. -/

/-! ### The Horvitz–Thompson estimator -/

/-- For [a population of units](hyp:U), [marginal treatment probabilities](hyp:p), [a
potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), [a unit](hyp:i), and [a realized treatment assignment](hyp:z),
the [unit-level Horvitz--Thompson summand](goal) is its observed outcome weighted by the reciprocal
of its treatment probability if treated, minus the same outcome weighted by the reciprocal of its
control probability if untreated. -/

  (if z i then (1 : ℝ) else 0) * y i z / p i
    - (if z i then (0 : ℝ) else 1) * y i z / (1 - p i)

/-- For [a finite population of units](hyp:U), [marginal treatment probabilities](hyp:p), [a
potential-outcome schedule](hyp:y), and [a realized treatment assignment](hyp:z), the
[Horvitz--Thompson estimator](goal) is the average of the units' treated-minus-control
inverse-probability-weighted outcome summands. -/
noncomputable def htEst (p : U → ℝ) (y : U → (U → Bool) → ℝ) (z : U → Bool) : ℝ :=
  (∑ i : U, htSummand p y i z) / (Fintype.card U : ℝ)

/-- When [unit `ℓ` does not interfere with unit `i`](hyp:h), [flipping `ℓ`'s treatment while
holding every other unit's assignment fixed never changes `i`'s realized outcome](goal).

The negation of `Interferes` unfolds to this pointwise invariance. -/

/-- **A unit's outcome depends only on the units that interfere with it.** If [two treatment
assignments `z` and `z'` agree on every unit that interferes with unit `i`](hyp:h), then
[unit `i`'s outcome is the same under both assignments: `y i z = y i z'`](goal).

This is the bridge from the interference structure to disjoint-block independence: when `i` and
`j` are not interference dependent, their interferer sets are disjoint, so the two HT summands
depend on disjoint coordinate blocks. -/
