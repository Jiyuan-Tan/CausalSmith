# Bai (2022): the matched-pair difference-in-means estimator

For a fixed matched-pair randomization design, each unit is the position `b : Bool` of a pair
`p : P`, with treated/control potential outcomes `y1 p b` / `y0 p b`.  Under the matched-pair design
the coin `z p` selects the treated position in pair `p`; the **matched-pair difference-in-means
estimator** averages, over pairs, the observed treated outcome minus the observed control outcome:
`τ̂ = (1/N) ∑ₚ (y1 p (zₚ) − y0 p (¬zₚ))`, with `N = |P|` pairs.  This file records the estimator, the
sample average treatment effect over the `2N` units, and the theorem that the matched-pair estimator
is **unbiased** for the SATE — each pair contributes its own average effect in expectation.

This is the estimator-side template: a design-based estimator written as a per-pair sum, with
unbiasedness reduced to the single-coordinate (per-pair) marginal of the product design.

For a fixed matched-pair randomization design, each unit is the position `b : Bool` of a pair
`p : P`, with treated/control potential outcomes `y1 p b` and `y0 p b`.  Under the matched-pair
design the coin `z p` selects the treated position in pair `p`; `pairContribution` records that
pair's observed treated-minus-control contrast `y1 p (z p) - y0 p (!z p)`.

This file defines the sample average treatment effect `sate`, the matched-pair
difference-in-means estimator `matchedPairEstimator`, the per-pair expectation identity
`E_pairContribution`, and the unbiasedness theorem `E_matchedPairEstimator` for Bai's
matched-pair design.
