# Disjoint-block independence of the product design

Functions of **disjoint coordinate blocks** of a product design are uncorrelated.  This
generalizes the single-coordinate facts `E_prod_apply₂` / `Cov_prod_apply_of_ne` in
`ProductVariance.lean` from singleton coordinates to arbitrary disjoint index sets, and is the
substrate behind both Horvitz–Thompson unbiasedness (`Z_i` vs. a function of the other
coordinates — block `{i}` vs. its complement) and the Sävje–Aronow–Hudgens variance bound
(two HT summands with disjoint interferer supports).

The payload is `E_prod_block_mul`: if `f` depends only on the coordinates in `A` and `g` only on
the coordinates outside `A`, then `E[f·g] = E[f]·E[g]` under the product design.  Two corollaries
package this as a vanishing covariance: `Cov_prod_block_zero` (complement split) and
`Cov_prod_disjoint_zero` (arbitrary disjoint blocks).

/-! # Disjoint-block independence for product designs

Functions of disjoint coordinate blocks factor under a finite product design.

The theorem `FiniteDesign.E_prod_block_mul` factors the expectation of `f * g` when `f` depends
only on coordinates in a block `A` and `g` depends only on the complement.  The covariance
corollaries `FiniteDesign.Cov_prod_block_zero` and `FiniteDesign.Cov_prod_disjoint_zero` package
that independence for complement blocks and for arbitrary disjoint blocks.

designs `D`](hyp:D) and [real-valued functions `f` and `g`](hyp:f,g) on the joint assignment
space, suppose [`f` is invariant under any change to the coordinates outside a block `A` — it
depends only on the coordinates in `A`](hyp:hf), and [`g` depends only on the coordinates outside
`A`](hyp:hg). Then [under the product design, the expectation of the product `f·g` factors as
