# Standard normal CDF facts (design-based presentation)

Thin adapter exposing the standard-normal cumulative distribution function to the design-based
interval theorems in the `.real (Iic t)` presentation they rely on definitionally.  The function
and every fact below are the canonical `Causalean.Mathlib.stdNormalCDF` from
`Causalean/Mathlib/Probability/StdNormalCDF.lean` — the single source of truth for the standard
normal CDF — re-exported under the `DesignBased.stdNormalCdf` name via `stdNormalCdf_eq`.  No proof
is duplicated here: nonnegativity, the upper bound, monotonicity, symmetry, and continuity all
delegate to the canonical lemmas.

/-! # Standard normal CDF adapter

The design-based standard-normal CDF is a namespace-local presentation of the canonical
Mathlib-facing CDF.

The definition `stdNormalCdf` uses the `.real (Iic t)` probability-measure presentation needed by
design-based interval and CLT statements, while `stdNormalCdf_eq` identifies it with
`Causalean.Mathlib.stdNormalCDF`. The remaining lemmas forward the reusable facts needed
downstream: nonnegativity, the upper bound by one, monotonicity, symmetry
`stdNormalCdf_neg`, and continuity `continuous_stdNormalCdf`.
