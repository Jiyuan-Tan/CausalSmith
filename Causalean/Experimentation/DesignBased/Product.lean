# Product of finite randomization designs

Given a finite family of independent designs `D i : FiniteDesign (α i)` — one per index
`i` (here: one per group in a partial-interference experiment) — their **product design**
`prodDesign D` randomizes every coordinate independently:

    (prodDesign D).p w = ∏ i, (D i).p (w i).

This is the substrate form of **partial interference**: assembling the within-group
randomizations into a product makes cross-group independence a structural fact, not an
assumption.  The key consequences are `E_prod_prod` (the expectation of a product of
single-coordinate functions factors into the product of coordinate expectations) and
`E_prod_apply` (a function of one coordinate has the marginal expectation of that
coordinate's design).

/-! # Product finite randomization designs

This file constructs `prodDesign`, the finite product of a family of independent randomization
designs.  Its probability mass function is the product of the coordinate probabilities, recorded by
`prodDesign_p`.

The main expectation identities are `FiniteDesign.E_prod_prod`, which factors expectations of
products of coordinate functions, and `FiniteDesign.E_prod_apply`, which says a statistic depending
on one coordinate has the expectation induced by that coordinate's marginal design. -/
