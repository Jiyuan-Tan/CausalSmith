# Design-based central limit theorem from a bounded-degree dependency graph

The Stein dependency-graph CLT engine
(`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.SteinMethod.bounded_degree_dependency_clt`) is
stated over abstract probability measures.  Feeding it the design measure `D.toMeasure` through the
measure bridge specialises it to the finite-design layer, yielding the studentized
CDF-convergence statement `Pr[ depSum(X)/√v ≤ s ] → Φ(s)` in the native `FiniteDesign.Pr` form.

This is the general design-based CLT behind every interference paper: express the centered,
standardized estimator as `depSum` of bounded, mean-zero, bounded-degree-dependent unit
contributions with a variance floor, and its studentized statistic is asymptotically standard
normal.  Its conclusion is exactly the `hclt` hypothesis of
`conservative_wald_liminf_of_feasible_studentized_cdf`, so the two compose into a complete
design-based Wald-interval pipeline.

/-! # Design-based dependency-graph CLT

`dependency_studentized_cdf` transports the bounded-degree dependency-graph CLT to the finite-design
layer: for a sequence of designs whose unit contributions `X n` are uniformly bounded, mean-zero,
and dependent only across a bounded-degree graph, with the standardizing variance `v n` bounded
below by a constant multiple of the number of units, the studentized statistic
`depSum(X n)/√(v n)` has standard-normal limiting CDF under `D n`.  It is stated in the
`FiniteDesign.Pr` form so it plugs directly into
`conservative_wald_liminf_of_feasible_studentized_cdf`.

/-- **Design-based dependency-graph CLT (studentized CDF form).** Consider [a sequence of finite
designs `D n`](hyp:D) together with [a triangular array of unit contributions `X n
i`](hyp:X) and, for each `n`, [a dependency-graph structure `Dep n` on the units](hyp:Dep).
Suppose [every neighbourhood in the dependency graph has size at most `Dmax`](hyp:hdeg), [the
contributions are uniformly bounded by a nonnegative constant `M`](hyp:hM,hbound), [each
contribution has design mean `0`](hyp:hmean), [the design second moment `v n` of the aggregate
`depSum(X n)` is recorded exactly](hyp:hv), [a positive constant `c` eventually lower-bounds `v n`
by `c` times the number of units](hyp:hc,hvc), and [the number of units diverges to
infinity](hyp:hcard). Then, at every point `s`, [the studentized aggregate `depSum(X n)/√(v n)`
has, under the design `D n`, a limiting CDF equal to the standard normal CDF at `s`](goal).

Obtained by feeding the design measure `D n .toMeasure` to the abstract Stein dependency-graph CLT
through the measure bridge; the conclusion is in the native `FiniteDesign.Pr` presentation so it can
be handed straight to `conservative_wald_liminf_of_feasible_studentized_cdf`. -/
