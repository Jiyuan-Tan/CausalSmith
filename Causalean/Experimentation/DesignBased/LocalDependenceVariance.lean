# A scale-free local-dependence variance bound

A design-based interference argument routinely has to bound the variance of a sum `∑ᵢ Fᵢ` of
unit-level terms that are *not* independent, because each term reads the treatments of a small
neighbourhood of units and neighbourhoods overlap.  This file records the sharpest elementary bound
of that kind on a Bernoulli assignment: if every term has mean zero and depends only on its own
block of units, and no single unit belongs to more than `d` blocks, then

    E[(∑ᵢ Fᵢ)²] ≤ d · ∑ᵢ E[Fᵢ²].

The proof goes through the centered-monomial (Walsh/Fourier) expansion of
`Designs/BernoulliMoments.lean`: locality confines each term's coefficients to the subsets of its
own block, so at most `d` terms can contribute to any one basis direction, and Cauchy–Schwarz on
each direction plus Parseval gives the bound.

The interest of the statement is what it does *not* assume: no uniform bound on the terms, no
explicit decorrelation hypothesis (locality supplies it), and no dependence on the population size.
Contrast `Experimentation/DesignBased/EdgeVarianceBound.lean`'s `var_edge_sum_le`, which is indexed
by the edges of a dependency graph, needs a uniform pointwise bound on the summands, takes
decorrelation as a hypothesis, and pays a population-size factor.

/-! # Local-dependence variance bound on a Bernoulli design

This file provides `BlockDegreeLE`, the condition that no unit lies in more than `d` of the
dependence blocks, and `bernoulliDesign_E_sum_sq_le_blockDegree_mul_sum_sq`, the resulting bound
`E[(∑ᵢ Fᵢ)²] ≤ d · ∑ᵢ E[Fᵢ²]` for mean-zero, block-dependent summands. -/

/-- For [a finite population of units](hyp:U), [a dependence block assigned to each unit](hyp:N),
and [a nonnegative integer bound](hyp:d), the [assertion that the block family has degree at most
$d$](goal) means that, for every unit, at most $d$ blocks contain that unit.  When the blocks are
the in-neighbourhoods of a dependency graph, this is the out-degree bound. -/

/-- **Local-dependence variance bound.** Under a Bernoulli design in which [every unit's treatment
probability lies strictly between `0` and `1`](hyp:hp0,hp1), suppose each unit `i` contributes a
term `F i` — attached to a dependence block `N i` — such that [no unit's treatment is read by more
than `d` of these blocks](hyp:hdeg), [every term has mean zero under the Bernoulli
design](hyp:hmean), and [each term `F i` depends only on the treatments of its own block `N
i`](hyp:hdep). Then [the second moment of the total `∑ᵢ F i` is at most `d` times the total of the
individual second moments, `d · ∑ᵢ E[(F i)²]`](goal). The bound is scale free: it needs no uniform
bound on the terms, no explicit decorrelation assumption, and no dependence on the population
size. -/
