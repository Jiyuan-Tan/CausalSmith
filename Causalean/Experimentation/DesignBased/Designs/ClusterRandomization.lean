# Cluster randomization

**Cluster randomization** assigns treatment at the level of clusters: each cluster `c` is treated by
an independent coin flip with probability `p c`, and every unit in a treated cluster is treated.  It
is the Bernoulli design over the cluster labels, read through the cluster-membership map `clus`.
This file records the design and its **inclusion probabilities**: a unit is treated with probability
`p (clus i)` (its cluster's rate); two units in the *same* cluster are jointly treated with that same
probability (their treatments coincide), while two units in *different* clusters are jointly treated
with the product of their cluster rates (clusters are independent).

/-! # Cluster randomization designs

Cluster randomization treats all units in a cluster according to one cluster-level coin flip.

This file packages cluster-level Bernoulli assignment and proves the resulting unit-level
inclusion probabilities for same-cluster and cross-cluster pairs.
