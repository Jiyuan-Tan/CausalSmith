# The Bernoulli randomization design

The **Bernoulli design** assigns each unit `i` to treatment by an independent coin flip with
unit-specific probability `p i`.  It is the product `prodDesign` of the per-unit coin designs, so
two distinct units' treatments are independent.  This file records the design and its
**inclusion probabilities** — the design facts an estimator's bias and variance are built from:
the first-order inclusion probability of a unit is `p i`, the treatment indicator has variance
`p i (1 − p i)`, and two distinct units' treatment indicators have joint expectation `p i · p j`
and zero covariance.

This is the paper-agnostic canonical Bernoulli design in the design zoo; the Sävje–Aronow–Hudgens
folder carries its own copy used by that paper's development.

/-! # Bernoulli randomization designs

Bernoulli designs assign each unit independently with unit-specific treatment probabilities.

This file builds the product Bernoulli design from the canonical single-coin design, then records
the first- and second-order inclusion facts used by estimator bias and variance calculations.
