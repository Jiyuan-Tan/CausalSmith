# Relabeling a product design by a coordinate permutation

This file records a single, reusable algebraic fact about the product of a finite family of
identical-coordinate-type randomization designs: permuting the coordinate index by a bijection
`σ : ι ≃ ι` relabels the product design.  Concretely, the probability that a permuted predicate
holds under the original product design equals the probability that the predicate holds under the
permuted product design.

The statement is purely a finite-sum reindexing — no measure theory — and is the clean kernel used
by the Liu–Hudgens identical-groups derivation to show that the conditional studentized CDF depends
on a stage-1 selection only through the number of selected groups.

/-! # Reindexing product designs

Permuting coordinate labels only relabels probabilities under a product design.

The theorem `FiniteDesign.prodDesign_Pr_reindex` is a finite-sum reindexing identity: for a
coordinate permutation `sigma`, the probability of a permuted predicate under `prodDesign D`
equals the probability of the original predicate under the correspondingly permuted product
design.  It is used to express selection symmetry in identical-group two-stage arguments without
invoking measure theory.

/-- **Relabeling a product design by a coordinate permutation.** For a family of designs `D` over a
common coordinate space `W`, indexed by `ι`, and a permutation `σ : ι ≃ ι`, [the probability under
`prodDesign D` of the predicate `w ↦ P (w ∘ σ)` equals the probability under the permuted product
`prodDesign (D ∘ σ)` of `P`](goal).

Pure finite-sum reindexing: precomposition by `σ` is a bijection of the assignment space `ι → W`,
and the product pmf reindexes term-by-term. -/
