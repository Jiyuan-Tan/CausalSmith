# Bridge: a finite randomization design as a measure-theoretic probability measure

The lightweight `FiniteDesign` (a pmf `p` on a finite `Ω` with `E`/`Var`/`Cov` finite sums) is
turned into an honest `MeasureTheory.Measure`, `D.toMeasure := ∑_z (p z)·δ_z`, so that the
design-based estimators can be fed to the measure-theoretic Stein CLT.  We prove the dictionary

* `D.toMeasure` is a probability measure;
* `∫ g ∂D.toMeasure = D.E g`;
* `D.toMeasure.real {z | A z} = D.Pr A`;
* `variance g D.toMeasure = D.Var g`.

`Ω` carries the top σ-algebra (every set measurable), so every function is measurable.

/-! # Finite designs as probability measures

Finite randomization designs can be viewed as ordinary probability measures, enabling reuse of
measure-theoretic probability results.

For a design `D`, `FiniteDesign.toMeasure` places mass `D.p z` at each assignment `z`. The induced
measure is registered as an `IsProbabilityMeasure`, and the bridge theorems
`integral_toMeasure`, `toMeasure_real_setOf`, and `variance_toMeasure` identify integrals, event
probabilities, and variances under `D.toMeasure` with the finite-design operations `D.E`, `D.Pr`,
and `D.Var`.
