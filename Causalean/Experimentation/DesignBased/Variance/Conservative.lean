# Conservative variance estimators

The randomization variance of a design-based estimator typically involves the unidentified
cross-products of potential outcomes, so it cannot be estimated unbiasedly; the standard remedy is a
**conservative** variance estimator `V̂`, whose expectation is at least the true variance.  This
file records that notion (`IsConservativeVarEst`), the basic way to certify it (an expectation that
equals the variance plus a nonnegative bias), and its purpose: a conservative variance estimator
yields a valid — indeed over-covering — Chebyshev tail bound, replacing the unknown true variance by
the estimable `E[V̂]`.

/-! # Conservative variance estimators

Conservative variance estimators have expectation at least the true finite-design variance.

`FiniteDesign.IsConservativeVarEst` states the comparison `Var X <= E[Vhat]`.  The lemmas
`FiniteDesign.isConservativeVarEst_of_E_eq_add` and
`FiniteDesign.isConservativeVarEst_of_unbiased` give common certification patterns, and
`FiniteDesign.chebyshev_conservative` turns conservativeness into a valid Chebyshev tail bound
with `E[Vhat]` in place of the unknown variance.
