# Law of total variance for the two-stage compound design

The total variance of a random variable under the two-stage `compound` design equals the
expected within-stage (stage-2 conditional) variance plus the variance of the stage-2
conditional mean across the stage-1 randomization:

    Var X = E_{stage 1}[ Var_{stage 2}(X | s) ] + Var_{stage 1}( E_{stage 2}(X | s) ).

This is the design-based form of the law of total variance.  It underlies the
between-group / within-group variance decompositions of design-based inference under
partial interference (e.g. the Hudgens–Halloran between-group variance theorems), where
stage 1 randomizes the group-level allocation strategies and stage 2 randomizes the
within-group assignments.  The enabling step is the tower property of expectation
(`E_compound_tower`): the compound expectation iterates as a stage-1 expectation of the
stage-2 (product-design) conditional expectation.

# Compound-design variance decomposition

This file proves the expectation tower property `FiniteDesign.E_compound_tower` for the two-stage
`compound` design and the corresponding law of total variance
`FiniteDesign.Var_compound_eq_tower`. The decomposition writes total variance as expected
within-stage variance plus the stage-1 variance of the stage-2 conditional mean, the algebraic form
used by partial-interference between-group and within-group variance decompositions.
