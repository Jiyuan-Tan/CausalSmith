# Design families, domination, and optimal designs

This file promotes the randomization design from a fixed object to a *parameter* that the
experimenter chooses.  A **design family** is a set of candidate designs on a common
assignment space; a **risk** `R` assigns each design an ordered value (such as its mean squared
error for a chosen estimator and target — see `mseRisk` — or any other criterion). One design
**dominates** another when it carries no larger risk, and a design is **optimal** in a
family when it dominates every member.  The main result is that over a nonempty *finite*
family an optimal design exists.  Keeping the optimality layer generic in `R` isolates the
order-theoretic content from the particular estimation problem being optimized.

# Design-family optimality criteria

This file treats a randomization design as the object being chosen from a finite family under an
ordered risk criterion.

The declarations `DesignFamily`, `Dominates`, and `IsOptimalOn` formalize candidate sets,
weak domination, and least-risk designs. The theorem `exists_isOptimalOn` shows that every
nonempty finite design family has an optimal member. The risk functional `mseRisk` packages the
mean squared error of a design-indexed estimator, with `mseRisk_nonneg` and
`mseRisk_eq_var_of_unbiased` connecting it to nonnegativity and variance for unbiased estimators.

/-! ### Mean-squared-error risk of a design-indexed estimator

The canonical risk: fix an estimator that may use each design's known probabilities
(`est D : Ω → ℝ`, e.g. Horvitz–Thompson) and a design-independent target `μ`; the risk of a
design is the estimator's mean squared error under it. -/

/-- For [a finite assignment space](hyp:Ω), [an estimator specified separately for each
randomization design](hyp:est), and [a real-valued target](hyp:μ), the [mean-squared-error risk
function](goal) assigns to each design the mean squared error of that design's estimator about the
target, evaluated under that design. -/
