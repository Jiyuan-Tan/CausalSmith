# Convergence in probability for finite randomization designs

A lightweight convergence-in-probability layer for the finite-design probability model, used to
analyze ratio (Hájek) estimators.  Along a sequence of designs `D m : FiniteDesign (Ω m)`, a
sequence of statistics `X m : Ω m → ℝ` converges in probability to a target sequence `c : ℕ → ℝ`
(`TendstoInProb D X c`) if the tail probabilities `Pr(|X m − c m| ≥ ε)` vanish for every `ε > 0`.

The substrate provides:
* `tendstoInProb_of_var` — the Chebyshev consistency engine: if the design variance of `X m`
  vanishes, then `X m → E[X m]` in probability;
* `TendstoInProb.sub` — closure under differences;
* `tendstoInProb_div_one` — the Slutsky ratio step: if `X m → a m`, the denominator `Y m → 1`, and
  the limits `a m` are uniformly bounded, then `X m / Y m → a m`.  This is exactly what turns
  Horvitz–Thompson convergence into Hájek convergence (the realized weight-sum normalizer tends to
  one).

/-! # Convergence in probability for finite designs

Finite-design convergence in probability tracks vanishing assignment-tail probabilities along a
sequence of randomization designs.

The predicate `FiniteDesign.TendstoInProb` states convergence of statistics `X m` to targets `c m`
using the design probabilities of absolute-deviation events. The theorem `tendstoInProb_of_var`
turns vanishing randomization variance into convergence to the design mean via Chebyshev's
inequality. The closure result `TendstoInProb.sub` handles differences, and
`tendstoInProb_div_one` is the Hájek/Slutsky ratio step for denominators converging in probability
to one.
