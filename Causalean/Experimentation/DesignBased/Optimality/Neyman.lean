# Neyman optimal allocation

For a two-arm experiment the randomization variance of the difference-in-means estimator, as a
function of the treatment fraction `x ∈ (0,1)`, has the form `A/x + B/(1−x)` with `A, B > 0` the
treated- and control-arm outcome variances.  **Neyman allocation** is the choice of `x` minimizing
this variance.  This file proves the analytic heart of the result: `A/x + B/(1−x)` is bounded below
by `(√A + √B)²` on `(0,1)`, and attains that minimum at the **Neyman fraction**
`x* = √A / (√A + √B)`, which therefore splits the sample in proportion to the arms' standard
deviations.

/-! # Neyman allocation

Neyman allocation minimizes the two-arm variance proxy by assigning in proportion to
standard deviations.

The definitions `neymanFraction` and `neymanOptimalValue` package the optimizer
`sqrt A / (sqrt A + sqrt B)` and the value `(sqrt A + sqrt B)^2`.  Theorems
`neyman_allocation_lower_bound`, `neyman_allocation_eq_at_fraction`, and
`neyman_allocation_isMinimizer` prove the lower bound, show equality at the Neyman
fraction, and state the resulting minimization property on the interval `(0, 1)`.

/-- For [a first real-valued input](hyp:A) and [a second real-valued input](hyp:B), [the Neyman
allocation fraction](goal) is $\sqrt{A}/(\sqrt{A}+\sqrt{B})$. When the inputs are nonnegative
arm variances, this is the ratio of the treated arm's standard deviation to the sum of the two
arms' standard deviations. -/
