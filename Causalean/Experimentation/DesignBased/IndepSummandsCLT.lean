# Independent-summands central limit theorem over product designs

A normalized sum of independent, uniformly bounded, mean-zero per-coordinate summands over a
product design converges in distribution to the standard normal — the independent-summands case
of the Stein dependency-graph CLT, with cross-coordinate independence supplied by the
product-measure bridge.

Concretely, for each `n` we have a finite family of independent coordinate designs `D n i` and
real summands `g n i : α n i → ℝ`, each bounded by `B n` (with `B n → 0` and `card·B³ → 0`) and
mean-zero, whose total sum `∑ᵢ g n i (w i)` has unit design variance.  The product design makes
the coordinate summands genuinely measure-theoretically independent, so the trivial **diagonal**
dependency graph `G a b := a = b` (every node depends only on itself, degree one) satisfies the
`DepGraph` independence field via `indepFun_prodDesign_apply_blocks`.  Feeding this into
`stein_cdf_clt_of_depGraph` yields `P[∑ᵢ g n i (w i) ≤ s] → Φ(s)`.  This is the
zero-dependence specialization of `localDependenceCLT_of_conditions`.

/-! # Independent-summands CLT for product designs

Product-design sums of independent bounded mean-zero summands satisfy a standard-normal limit.

The construction `diagDepGraph` supplies the dependency graph whose only edges are self-edges, with
independence coming from finite product designs. The theorem `prodDesign_clt` then specializes the
dependency-graph Stein CLT: uniformly bounded, mean-zero coordinate summands with vanishing
third-moment envelope and unit total design variance have standard-normal distributional limits
under the product design.

/-- At each stage suppose the coordinate index set and every coordinate assignment space are
finite, coordinate equality is decidable, and every singleton in every coordinate assignment
space is measurable. For [a family of coordinate-specific randomization designs, indexed by stage
and coordinate](hyp:D), [a family of real-valued coordinate summands](hyp:g), and [a stage](hyp:n),
[the diagonal dependency graph](goal) is the dependency graph of the coordinate summands under the
corresponding product design, in which two coordinates are adjacent exactly when they are the same
coordinate.

Its independence property follows from independence of disjoint coordinate blocks under the
product design. -/
