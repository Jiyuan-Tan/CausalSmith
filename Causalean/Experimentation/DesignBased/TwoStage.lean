# Compound (two-stage) randomization designs

A **compound design** models a two-stage randomization: a stage-1 design `D₁` on `Ω₁`
(e.g. which groups receive which allocation strategy), and then, conditionally on the
stage-1 outcome `s`, an independent within-coordinate design `D₂ s i` for each index `i`
(e.g. the within-group treatment randomization, whose distribution may depend on the strategy
group `i` was assigned).  The joint pmf is

    (compound D₁ D₂).p (s, w) = D₁.p s · ∏ i, (D₂ s i).p (w i).

The workhorse is `E_compound_factor`: the expectation of `h(s)·g(wⱼ)` — a stage-1 quantity
times a function of a single group's within-assignment — collapses the inner (stage-2)
randomization to the marginal expectation of group `j`'s conditional design,
`E[h(s)·g(wⱼ)] = E_{s}[h(s)·E_{D₂ s j}[g]]`.  This is the substrate engine behind the
Hudgens–Halloran unbiasedness theorems.

/-! # Two-stage compound randomization designs

Compound designs combine a stage-one design with conditionally independent stage-two designs.

The definition `compound` builds the joint finite design on `(stage_one, stage_two_assignments)`
from a first-stage design and conditionally independent coordinate designs.  Lemma
`FiniteDesign.E_compound` expands expectations as an iterated finite sum, and
`FiniteDesign.E_compound_factor` collapses the stage-two expectation of a statistic that depends on
one coordinate to that coordinate's conditional marginal expectation.
