# Exposure mappings and the generalized probability of exposure

Following Aronow & Samii (2017), an *exposure mapping* `f : Ω → Θ → Δ` sends an
assignment vector `z` and a unit's traits `θ i` (e.g. its row in a network adjacency
matrix) to the *exposure* that unit receives.  The exposure unit `i` receives under
assignment `z` is `expo f θ i z = f z (θ i)`.

The *generalized probability of exposure* `prop D f θ i d = Pr[expo i = d]` is the
design probability that unit `i` is subject to exposure `d`; it is known exactly from
the design.  We also record the joint exposure probabilities `propPairSame` (both `i`
and `j` in exposure `d`) and `propPairCross` (`i` in `d`, `j` in `d'`), which drive the
Horvitz–Thompson variance formulas downstream.

/-! # Exposure mappings and generalized exposure probabilities

Exposure mappings turn assignments and unit traits into treatment conditions, and generalized
exposure probabilities are the design probabilities of those conditions.

The basic declarations are `expo`, the indicator `expoInd`, the marginal probability `prop`, and
the joint probabilities `propPairSame` and `propPairCross`. The covariance lemmas
`Cov_expoInd_same` and `Cov_expoInd_cross` rewrite indicator covariances into those probabilities,
while `expoInd_mul_self_of_ne` and `propPairCross_self_of_ne` record that one unit cannot occupy two
distinct exposures in the same assignment. For finite exposure spaces, `sum_prop_eq_one` shows that
each unit's exposure probabilities sum to one.
