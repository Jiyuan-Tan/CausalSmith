# Local-dependence CLT interface (Aronow-Samii 2017, via Chen-Shao 2004)

Asymptotic normality of the Horvitz–Thompson effect estimator under interference rests on a
central limit theorem for locally dependent random fields, proved via Stein's method
(Chen & Shao 2004, Thm 2.7).  The `LocalDependenceCLT` structure packages the exact convergence
statement consumed by the interval theorem, while `SteinInstance.lean` connects this interface to
the dependency-graph Stein CLT developed elsewhere in the library.

/-- Given [an experiment](hyp:E), [two target exposure levels](hyp:dk,dl), and [a realized
assignment](hyp:z), the [studentized Horvitz--Thompson effect statistic](goal) is the estimated
effect minus the corresponding finite-population effect, divided by the true standard deviation
of the estimator under the randomization design. -/

/-- **Chen-Shao local-dependence CLT interface, bounded-neighborhood case.** Along a sequence of
experiments `Exp` with a chosen pair of exposure levels `dk`, `dl` at each sample size, this
records that [the design probability that the studentized Horvitz–Thompson effect statistic
falls below any fixed threshold converges, as the sample size grows, to the standard normal CDF
at that threshold](hyp:tendsto_cdf).

The bounded-summand and bounded-degree
conditions that imply this interface are connected to the dependency-graph Stein CLT in
`SteinInstance.lean`. -/
