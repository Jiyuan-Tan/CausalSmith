# Network-HAC variance-estimator consistency

This roll-up imports the variance bound for the network-HAC estimator and the Chebyshev
consistency theorem.  The variance side provides `netHACVarEst_eq_locProd`,
`netHACVarEst_variance_le`, and `netHACVarEst_variance_tendsto_zero`; the consistency side provides
`netHACVarEst_memLp` and `netHAC_consistent`.  Together they show that the empirical neighborhood
cross-product estimator converges in probability to the variance of the m-dependent network sum
under the CLT-rate boundedness conditions.
