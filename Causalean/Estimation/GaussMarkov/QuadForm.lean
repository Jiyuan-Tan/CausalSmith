# Finite variance quadratic form for linear estimators

Foundational layer for the finite Gauss-Markov / BLUE theory.

Given a finite family of observations with covariance matrix `S : Matrix Obs Obs ℝ`
(written `Σ` in the prose), a *linear estimator* with weight vector `w : Obs → ℝ`
evaluates to `∑ i, w i * Yᵢ`.  Its variance is the quadratic form `wᵀ Σ w`.  This
file defines that functional (`quadVar`), the spherical-errors condition
`Σ = σ² • I`, and the two basic facts the ordering theory needs: the spherical
reduction `quadVar = σ² ‖w‖²` and nonnegativity for a positive-semidefinite
covariance.

The probability-theoretic justification that `Var(∑ wᵢ Yᵢ) = wᵀ Σ w` (where
`Σ i j = cov(Yᵢ, Yⱼ)`) lives in `Causalean/Estimation/GaussMarkov/Variance.lean`;
the minimum-variance ordering theorems live in
`Causalean/Estimation/GaussMarkov/LeastNorm.lean`.

/-! # Quadratic Variance Form

This file provides the deterministic quadratic-form layer of the finite
Gauss-Markov theory.  The definition `quadVar S w = w ⬝ᵥ S *ᵥ w` is the
weight-covariance-weight variance functional for a finite linear estimator, and
`SphericalErrors S σ` records the scalar-identity covariance condition
`S = σ² • I`.

The main reusable facts are `quadVar_nonneg`, nonnegativity under a
positive-semidefinite covariance matrix, and `quadVar_spherical`, the reduction
`quadVar S w = σ² * (w ⬝ᵥ w)` under spherical errors.  The probability-theoretic
bridge to actual random variables is in `GaussMarkov/Variance.lean`; the
least-variance ordering theorems are in `GaussMarkov/LeastNorm.lean`. -/

/-- For [a finite observation index set](hyp:Obs), [a real covariance matrix indexed by
that set](hyp:S), and [a real weight assigned to each observation](hyp:w), the
[quadratic variance form](goal) is $w^\mathsf{T} S w$.

This is the deterministic algebraic object; the bridge to
`ProbabilityTheory.variance` of an actual random linear combination is
`variance_linearCombination` in `Variance.lean`. -/
