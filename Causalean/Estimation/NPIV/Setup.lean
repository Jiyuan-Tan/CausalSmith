# NPIV / TRAE setup: linear inverse-problem functional system

This file provides the substrate for the non-iterated Tikhonov regularized
adversarial estimator (TRAE) of Bennett, Kallus, Mao, Newey, Syrgkanis, and
Uehara (2023). The target is a scalar linear functional of a primal solution
to a linear inverse problem; the main algebraic object is a doubly
robust score built from the primal solution and from the solution of a dual
inverse problem.

Mirrors the following definitions from
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation/trae_inverse_problems.tex`:

* `def:est-trae-system` — the linear inverse-problem functional system.
* `def:est-trae-dual-solution` — the dual solution `q₀`.
* `def:est-trae-dr-functional` — the doubly-robust functional `Θ` and its
  pointwise score `φ_{h,q}`.

The candidate sets `Hbar, Qbar` are kept as plain sets of ℝ-valued functions;
the Hilbert, `Lp`, and projection structure is added by later operator-system
files. This setup layer records the moment-equation contract and the linearity
needed for the mixed-bias proof.

/-! ## Linear inverse-problem functional system -/

/-- A **linear inverse-problem functional system** packages [an observation space together with
measurable treatment-side and instrument-side covariate projections of the observed
data](hyp:𝒲,𝒳,𝒵,W,meas_W,xOf,zOf,meas_xOf,meas_zOf), [measurable closed candidate sets for the
primal and dual nuisances, each closed under
subtraction](hyp:Hbar,Qbar,meas_of_Hbar,meas_of_Qbar,Hbar_sub,Qbar_sub), [observation-level moment
maps that are linear in their nuisance argument, jointly measurable and integrable against every
candidate](hyp:m,m_e,m_sub,m_e_sub,measurable_m,measurable_m_e,integrable_m,integrable_m_e), whose
[cross product `q(Z)h(X)` is integrable as well](hyp:integrable_qh), and [a primal nuisance in the
candidate set satisfying the inverse-problem moment equation against every dual
candidate](hyp:h₀,h₀_mem,primal_moment) (`def:est-trae-system`).

The structure carries:

* an observation space `𝒲` and covariate components `𝒳`, `𝒵` together with
  the random variables `W, X, Z` on `Ω`;
* candidate sets `Hbar ⊆ (𝒳 → ℝ)` and `Qbar ⊆ (𝒵 → ℝ)` for the primal and dual
  nuisances; closure under subtraction is the only algebraic property recorded
  at this setup layer;
* observation-level moment maps `m(W; q)` and `m_e(W; h)`, linear in their
  nuisance argument;
* the primal nuisance `h₀ ∈ Hbar` satisfying the combined inverse-problem
  moment `E[m(W; q)] = E[h₀(X) q(Z)]` for every `q ∈ Qbar`.

Measurability and integrability obligations are recorded as fields so the
mixed-bias identity in `MixedBias.lean` can use linearity-of-integral on
`Hbar - Hbar` and `Qbar - Qbar`. -/
