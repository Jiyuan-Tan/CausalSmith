# Base Localized Events for Primal NPIV

This file supplies the shared Ω-side infrastructure for turning product-space
localized deviation inequalities into events on the ambient sample space.  The
law bridge `integral_comp_law_W` rewrites population means under the observation
law as integrals over `S.W`, and `localized_omega_event_sharp_for_bundle`
pulls the sharp localized event for an abstract `LocalizedRegimeBundle` back
along an IID sample.  The class-specific event files for `H`, `F`, `H · F`, and
`m ∘ F` instantiate this wrapper through their `LocalizedRegimes`
interpretation fields.

/-! ## Per-class Ω-side localized deviation helpers

The four helpers below isolate the deferred infrastructure obligation:
each takes a `LocalizedRegimes` value at sample size `n` and produces an
Ω-event of mass `≥ 1 - δ` on which the empirical-vs-population deviation
along the **first `n` observations of the IID sample** is bounded by the
localized rate, *for the relevant concrete function class*.

The helpers are stated abstractly in `n`: callers in the public theorems
below instantiate `n := split.n₁ horizon` so the deviation is on the
fold-A subsample.  This works because the IID sample restricted to any
finite index set is again IID with marginal `P_W`.

The concrete helpers are routine applications of
`localized_uniform_deviation`, followed by the IID-sample joint
pushforward identity, the per-bundle interpretation fields linking the
abstract class to the concrete NPIV losses, and the law bridge
`regime.law_W`.  The shared wrapper pulls the product-space sharp event back along
the IID sample and keeps the diameter obligation available for each concrete index. -/

/-- Integrating a measurable function under the law of the observed variable is the same as
integrating its pullback over the ambient sample space. -/

/-- **Ω-side Foster–Syrgkanis sharp localized event for a single NPIV
`LocalizedRegimeBundle`.** Consider an IID sample drawn from a probability space, where
[the pushforward of the ambient measure under the observed-variable map equals the stated
observation law $P_W$](hyp:h_law_W) and [the sample size n is positive](hyp:hn). Fix a
confidence parameter ζ with [$0 < ζ ≤ 1$](hyp:hζ_pos,hζ_le), a localized rate $δ_n$ with
[$δ_n > 0$](hyp:hδn_pos), and a radius `Rmax`. If [there is a dyadic level K with
`Rmax ≤ δ_n · 2 ^ K` whose corresponding complexity term stays
below `δ_n ^ 2`](hyp:hslack), then [there is an event of probability at least `1 - ζ` on
which, for every index in the regime bundle whose function norm is at most `Rmax`, the
empirical average of that function over the first n sample draws deviates from its
population mean by at most `10 * δ_n * norm + 5 * δ_n ^ 2`](goal).

This is the NPIV-facing wrapper around
`localized_uniform_deviation_sharp`: it transports the product-space event
for `(Fin n → S.𝒲)` back to the ambient sample space through `sample` and
rewrites the population mean under `P_W` as an integral over `S.W`.
Concrete HF/mF/F/H event lemmas can instantiate the abstract index `i`
through their interpretation fields. -/
