# AIPW second-order remainder bound (ATT) — umbrella module

This file is the public entry point for the ATT AIPW remainder package.  The
population remainder identity sits in `Remainder/Identity.lean`, and the
quantitative L²-product bound plus its `o_p(n^{-1/2})` corollary sit in
`Remainder/Bound.lean`.  Mirrors `Estimation/ATE/Remainder.lean`.

/-!
Roll-up for the ATT second-order AIPW remainder development. It re-exports
`aipw_remainder_identity_ATT`, which rewrites the population moment error as the
single cross-product of control-regression and propensity errors, and
`aipw_remainder_bound_ATT`, which bounds that identity by the corresponding
`L²(P_X)` product under one-sided overlap.

The stochastic corollary `aipw_remainder_op_ATT` packages the same product-rate
condition as an `o_p(n^{-1/2})` remainder for ATT double machine learning.
