# DR-Learner causal instantiation of the orthogonal statistical-learning framework

This file builds a `LearningSystem` whose data is the CATE observation triple
`(X, A, Y)`, whose loss is the AIPW pseudo-outcome
squared error

    ℓ_DR(z; θ, η) := (φ_η(z) − eval θ z.1)²,

and whose target `θ₀` is a witness to `eval θ₀ = τ_val` (the value-space
CATE) and minimizes the true-nuisance population risk over the target class.
We then state the headline orthogonality lemma
`prop:est-osl-dr-loss-orthogonal`: this loss is Neyman-orthogonal at
`(τ₀, h₀)` in the sense of `def:est-osl-neyman-loss`.

The target type `Θ` is left as a free `NormedAddCommGroup`/
`InnerProductSpace ℝ` parameter (mirroring the generic `LearningSystem`); the
candidate-evaluation map `eval : Θ → γ → ℝ` connects the abstract `Θ` to
the concrete CATE function class.  This way the file is reusable for both
the function-space view (`Θ := L²(P_X)`) and the finite-dimensional view
(`Θ := EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin K)`).

The nuisance space `G := NuisanceVec γ` already carries `AddCommGroup`
and `Module ℝ` instances (see `Estimation/ATE/AIPWMoment.lean`), so the
typeclass requirements of `LearningSystem` are met without changing the generic
framework.

See `doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation/orthogonal_statistical_learning.tex`,
`prop:est-osl-dr-loss-orthogonal` (lines 143–160).

Builds the DR-Learner orthogonal-learning system for CATE estimation. It
defines the bounded nuisance slice `BoundedNuisanceDirs`, target-minimization
predicates for the ordinary and clamped risks, and the `drLearningSystem`
instance. The theorem `drNeymanOrthog_witness` adapts abstract score-flatness
and dominated-convergence hypotheses into a `NeymanOrthogLoss` witness for the
DR-Learner squared loss.

/-! ## DR-Learner orthogonal-learning system -/

/-- On a measurable covariate space, given [a nuisance-function vector at the truth](hyp:η₀), the [bounded-direction nuisance slice](goal) is the set of all nuisance-function vectors for which [the outcome-regression difference from the truth is uniformly bounded over both treatment arms and covariate values](step:1), and the propensity-score difference from the truth is uniformly bounded over covariate values.

Bounded-direction nuisance slice anchored at `η₀`.

`BoundedNuisanceDirs η₀` is the set of `η : NuisanceVec γ` whose
deviation `η − η₀` has uniformly bounded outcome-regression and
propensity components.  This is the natural ambient slice for the
Neyman-orthogonality argument: `dr_scoreZero_of_bounded` (in
`Estimation/CATE/OrthogonalLearning/DRLearner/Analytic.lean`) discharges the integrated score-zero
obligation precisely on this set, so taking
`drLearningSystem.G_set := BoundedNuisanceDirs η₀` lets the abstract
`LearningSystem`-level orthogonality conclusion be hypothesis-free without
relying on integral-defaults-to-zero conventions for unbounded
directions.

The set is a vector subspace of `NuisanceVec γ` (closed under sums and
scalar multiples) and contains `η₀` itself (witnessed by `Cμ = Ce = 0`).

The DR-Learner target `θ₀` minimizes the population squared-loss risk
against the true nuisance over the candidate target class.

This is the concrete CATE-side form of the `LearningSystem` target condition:
for every admissible target, the risk of the candidate whose evaluation equals
the value-space CATE is no larger than the risk of that target. -/

The DR-Learner target `θ₀` minimizes the clamped true-nuisance squared
loss used by almost-everywhere empirical-process reductions.

/-- Given [a CATE estimation system with a standard Borel unit space and finite population measure](hyp:S), [a real inner-product target space](hyp:Θ), [a convex candidate target set](hyp:Θ_set,Θ_convex), [a designated candidate target belonging to that set](hyp:θ₀,θ₀_mem), [an evaluation map whose evaluation is measurable for every candidate](hyp:eval,eval_meas), [the condition that the designated target evaluates pointwise to the system's conditional average treatment effect](hyp:_eval_θ₀), and [the condition that it minimizes the true-nuisance population squared pseudo-outcome risk over the candidate set](hyp:θ₀_minimizes), the [DR-Learner orthogonal statistical-learning system](goal) has observed-data law given by the CATE system, nuisance functions given by outcome regressions and a propensity score, and squared augmented inverse-probability-weighted pseudo-outcome loss.

The DR-Learner orthogonal-learning system: a `LearningSystem` whose data law is the CATE
observation triple's joint law `P_Z`, target space `Θ` is a
user-provided convex subset of an inner-product space (with a candidate
evaluation map `eval : Θ → γ → ℝ`), nuisance space `G := NuisanceVec γ`,
and loss

    ℓ z θ η := (phi_eta z η − eval θ z.1)².

The argument `eval_θ₀ : ∀ x, eval θ₀ x = S.τ_val x` is the truth-witness
identifying `θ₀` with the value-space CATE, and `θ₀_minimizes` states that
this candidate minimizes the true-nuisance population squared-loss risk over
`Θ_set`. The `G_set` is the bounded-direction slice `BoundedNuisanceDirs η₀`;
downstream callers can restrict further (e.g. to the strict-overlap slice
`H_ε`) if needed.

/-! ## Headline orthogonality lemma -/

/-- **DR-Learner loss orthogonality** (`prop:est-osl-dr-loss-orthogonal`). For a CATE
estimation system built on a potential-outcome model that satisfies [the back-door
identification assumptions](hyp:_hA) with [the propensity score bounded away from 0
and 1 by some margin (strict overlap)](hyp:_hOverlap), fix a convex candidate target
class inside an inner-product space together with a real-valued evaluation map on
it, and suppose [the candidate θ₀ belongs to this class](hyp:θ₀_mem), [every
candidate's evaluation is measurable](hyp:eval_meas), [θ₀'s evaluation agrees
pointwise with the true value-space CATE](hyp:eval_θ₀), and [θ₀ minimizes the
population AIPW pseudo-outcome squared-loss risk against the true nuisance over the
candidate class](hyp:θ₀_minimizes). If, for the resulting DR-Learner learning
system, [a dominated-convergence bridge licenses passing the limit defining the
mixed target/nuisance directional derivative through the integral](hyp:hBridge) and
[the integrated target-directional score has vanishing derivative, at every point of
the bounded nuisance slice and for every candidate target, along the segment toward
that point from the true nuisance](hyp:hScoreFlat), then [the DR-Learner squared
loss is Neyman-orthogonal: its integrated mixed directional derivative between
target and nuisance directions vanishes at the truth `(θ₀, η₀)` for every admissible
target and nuisance direction](goal).

Under the back-door causal assumptions and strict overlap, the DR-Learner
squared loss is Neyman-orthogonal at the truth `(τ₀, η₀)`.

Mathematically, the proof follows the conditional Riesz cancellation
argument from the natural-language note:

* `D_θ L_DR(τ₀, η)[ν_θ] = -2 𝔼[(φ_η(Z) − τ₀(X)) · ν_θ(X)]`.
* Differentiate this in the nuisance directions `ν_η = (ν_μ, ν_e)`.
* The outcome-regression directions vanish via the conditional Riesz
  identity (proved in `Estimation/CATE/ConditionalBias.lean` as
  `cond_exp_residual_at_h` / `phi_eta_minus_phi₀_cond_exp`).
* The propensity direction vanishes via the conditional residual identity
  `cond_exp_residual_zero` from `Estimation/ATE/MeanZero.lean`.

In the abstract `LearningSystem` framework these analytic steps reduce to two
inputs that any concrete instantiation must supply:

* `hBridge : MixedScoreDCTBridge ... M` — the DCT swap that interchanges
  the limit defining the mixed directional derivative with the population
  integral.  In the DR setting this follows from strict overlap and the
  bounded-by-`ε⁻¹` envelopes already used in
  `phi_eta_minus_phi₀_cond_exp`.
* `hScoreFlat` — the *score-form* orthogonality: the integrated target
  directional derivative `g ↦ ∫ z, (M.Dθ_at g).dℓ_θ θ z ∂P_Z` has zero
  derivative at `g₀` for every admissible target direction `ν_θ`.  In the
  DR setting this is the closed-form statement that the conditional bias
  identity `phi_eta_minus_phi₀_cond_exp` produces a remainder bilinear in
  `(η.μ - η₀.μ, η.e - η₀.e)`, hence quadratic along any nuisance ray
  `η₀ + t • (η - η₀)`.

Given those two abstract inputs, orthogonality is a routine consequence of
`neymanOrthog_iff_score_deriv_zero`. The back-door and overlap assumptions are
carried for the DR-Learner interface but are ignored by this abstract adapter;
the theorem assumes the `hBridge` and `hScoreFlat` obligations directly. The
concrete analytic DR orthogonality result is `drNeymanOrthog`. -/
