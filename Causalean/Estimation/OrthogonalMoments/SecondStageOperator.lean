# Abstract second-stage regression operator for the DR-Learner CATE estimator

This file provides the abstract `SecondStageOperator` bundle described in
`doc/basic_concepts/po/estimation/dr_learner_cate.tex`
(`def:est-cate-second-stage`, `def:est-cate-stability`, `thm:est-cate-dr-oracle`).

The operator takes:
* a sample-size index `n`,
* a randomness scope `Ω` (carrying the data fold and any auxiliary randomness),
* a real-valued pseudo-outcome `f : γ × Bool × ℝ → ℝ` defined on data tuples
  `z = (x, a, y)`, and
* an evaluation point `x : γ`,

and returns a real number `̂E_{n,B}{f(Z) | X = x}`.

The structure here is deliberately abstract: the linear-smoother specialisation
lives in `Causalean/Estimation/OrthogonalMoments/LinearSmoother.lean`, and callers supply a
`BiasIdent` predicate to `Stable` / `oracle_expansion` to encode the
conditional-bias identification (e.g. AIPW DR cross-product = condExp at fold A).

`oracle_expansion` is fully proved (one-line application of `Stable`).

/-! # Abstract Second-Stage Regression Operators

This file defines the target-agnostic second-stage operator used in DR-Learner
CATE estimation. The public API consists of `SecondStageOperator`, the
input-linearity predicate `SecondStageOperator.IsLinearInInput`, the oracle
estimator and oracle risk scale, the stability predicate `Stable`, and the
abstract oracle-expansion theorem `oracle_expansion`. It separates the operator
itself from linearity and conditional-bias identification assumptions. -/

/-- Abstract bundle for a second-stage regression operator (Def `def:est-cate-second-stage`):
[an operator](hyp:evalAt) mapping a sample size, a randomness scope, a real-valued pseudo-outcome
function of a data tuple, and a query point to a real-valued estimate, together with the minimal
requirement that [for every sample size and constant pseudo-outcome, the map from randomness
scope and query point to the operator's value is jointly measurable](hyp:meas_evalAt_const);
stronger measurability, and any linearity of the operator in its function input, are deferred to
concrete instances or the separate `IsLinearInInput` predicate.

* `evalAt n ω f x` is the operator at sample size `n`, randomness scope `ω : Ω`,
  applied to the pseudo-outcome `f : γ × Bool × ℝ → ℝ` and evaluated at the
  query point `x : γ`.
* `meas_evalAt_const` is a minimal joint-measurability assumption: for every
  fixed constant pseudo-outcome `(fun _ => c)` the resulting
  `(ω, x) ↦ evalAt n ω _ x` is jointly measurable. Stronger measurability
  assumptions (e.g. measurability in the function argument) are deferred to
  concrete instances.

The linearity of the operator in its function input is **not** required by the
structure; instead it is supplied as the separate predicate `IsLinearInInput`
below. This keeps the structure usable for nonlinear smoothers (e.g. local
constant regression). -/

/-- For [a second-stage regression operator](hyp:op), [linearity in the
pseudo-outcome input](goal) means that, for every sample size, randomness
realization, pair of real-valued pseudo-outcome functions, and query point,
the estimate for their pointwise sum equals the sum of their separate estimates.
Linear smoothers satisfy this predicate; kernel-or-tree mean estimators with
random splits need not satisfy it. -/

/-- Given [a second-stage regression operator](hyp:op) and [a fixed
real-valued pseudo-outcome function](hyp:f), the [oracle estimator](goal) maps
each sample size, randomness realization, and query point to the operator's
estimate using that fixed pseudo-outcome. -/

/-- Given [a second-stage regression operator](hyp:op), [a fixed real-valued
pseudo-outcome function](hyp:f), [a target function](hyp:target), [a query
point](hyp:x), and [a sample size](hyp:n), the [oracle pointwise risk scale](goal)
is the square root of the expected squared difference, over the operator's
randomness, between the oracle estimator and the target at that query point.

Oracle pointwise risk scale `R^*_n(x)` from `def:est-cate-dr-learner`:

  `R^*_n(x) := sqrt( ∫ (op.evalAt n ω f x - target x)^2 ∂μ )`.

This is the L²(μ) deviation of the oracle estimator from `target` at the
fixed query point `x`, treated as a deterministic function of `n`. -/

/-- Given [a second-stage regression operator](hyp:op), [a target function](hyp:target),
[a sequence of distances between pseudo-outcomes](hyp:d_n), [a query point](hyp:x), and
[a conditional-bias identification criterion](hyp:BiasIdent), [stability](goal) means
that for every estimated pseudo-outcome sequence, true pseudo-outcome, and claimed
conditional-bias sequence satisfying the criterion, convergence of the distance to zero
in probability implies that the operator discrepancy after subtracting the smoothed bias
is negligible in probability relative to the oracle pointwise risk scale.

For every sequence of estimated pseudo-outcomes `fHat_n` and every true
pseudo-outcome `f`, with claimed conditional bias `bHat_n`, if `d_n →_p 0` and
the user-supplied conditional-bias identification predicate `BiasIdent`
holds, then the operator-level discrepancy between `evalAt _ fHat_n` and
`evalAt _ f`, *minus* the smoothed bias term `evalAt _ (bHat_n)`, is
`o_p(R^*_n(x))`.

`BiasIdent` encodes the concrete conditional-bias identification (e.g.
`bHat_n n ω u =ᵐ μ[fHat_n n ω Z − f Z | A_σ(n), σ(X) = u]` for a DR-Learner
with the AIPW pseudo-outcome). Concrete instances pass their explicit
identification predicate. -/

/-- **Oracle expansion for the DR-Learner** (Thm `thm:est-cate-dr-oracle`, abstract
operator-level form). Given [a second-stage regression operator `op` that is stable at the
query point `x` for target function `target`, with respect to a distance `d_n` between
pseudo-outcomes and a caller-supplied conditional-bias identification predicate
`BiasIdent`](hyp:op,target,x,d_n,BiasIdent,hStab), suppose [`d_n` converges to zero in
probability under μ, i.e. the first-stage pseudo-outcome estimate is
consistent](hyp:hCons), and suppose [the estimated pseudo-outcome `fHat_n`, the true
pseudo-outcome `f`, and the claimed conditional bias `bHat_n` satisfy
`BiasIdent`](hyp:fHat_n,f,bHat_n,hBias). Then [the discrepancy between the operator applied to
`fHat_n` and to `f`, minus the operator applied to `bHat_n`, is `o_p` of the oracle risk scale
under μ](goal): the operator-level oracle expansion holds modulo `o_p(R^*_n(x))`.

The model-specific input — Prop `prop:est-cate-dr-bias-identity` — enters
through `hBias : BiasIdent …`, which the caller supplies.

NOTE: statement is the operator-level conclusion `̂E{fHat} − ̂E{f} − ̂E{bHat} =
o_p(R^*_n(x))`; the rearrangement to `\hat\tau^{DR}_n(x) - \tilde\tau_n(x)
= ̂E{bHat_n} + o_p(R^*_n(x))` is bookkeeping handled at the application site. -/
