                                        with measurability witnesses, equipped
                                        with componentwise `AddCommGroup` and
                                        `Module ℝ` instances so it can be fed
                                        to `NeymanOrthogonal`.

                                        `DTRNuisanceVec₂ γ → … → ℝ`.

Bundle ordering convention: cons-order `(s₁, d₀, s₀)` matches
`historyBundle 1 = cons S₁ (cons D₀ (cons S₀ nil))` from `Setup.lean`.
The data tuple is `(s₀, d₀, s₁, d₁, y) : γ 0 × δ × γ 1 × δ × ℝ`.

# Sequential DR Moment for Two-Stage Regimes

This file defines the explicit two-stage sequential AIPW moment for dynamic
treatment regimes, its truth-level influence function, and the overlap-bounded
nuisance space used by the abstract DML layer.  The target is the fixed-regime
mean for a two-period regime, and the score uses stagewise inverse-propensity
weights centered by the target estimand.

The development is intentionally specialized to horizon two; the treatment space
is discrete enough to support equality indicators.  The stage-1 history is stored
in cons order as the current state, previous treatment, and previous state.

`e₁_fn` are the second-stage outcome regression and treatment propensity as
functions of second-period covariates, the first-period treatment/action, and
first-period covariates. The remaining fields certify measurability of these
four nuisance functions. -/

/-- For [a population outcome system](hyp:P), [a treatment space](hyp:δ), and [the pair of first- and second-period state spaces](hyp:γ), given [a two-stage dynamic treatment-regime estimation system](hyp:S), the [sequential doubly
robust moment functional](goal) maps every stagewise nuisance vector, observed two-stage data tuple,
and candidate regime mean to the sequential doubly robust moment for the system's target regime.

This is the sequential doubly robust moment packaged as a functional of nuisance, data, and target value. -/
