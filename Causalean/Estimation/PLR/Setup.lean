# Partially linear DML: value-space estimation system and moment instance

This file builds the value-space estimation system `PLRSystem` for the partially
linear model (analogue of `BackdoorEstimationSystem` for the back-door ATE) and
instantiates the abstract double-machine-learning `GeneralMoment` framework with
the Robinson partialling-out score.

* `PLRSystem` — a `POPartialLinearModel` together with value-space representatives
  `ℓ_val, m_val : γ → ℝ` of the outcome and treatment regressions (the ML
  targets), their compatibility with `E[Y|σX]` / `E[D|σX]`, and the
  nondegeneracy `E[(D − m_val(X))²] ≠ 0` (residual treatment variation).
* `P_Z`, `P_X` — the joint observed-data law and the covariate marginal.
* `plrGeneralMoment` — the `GeneralMoment` instance: moment `ψ`, truth nuisance
  `η₀ = (ℓ_val, m_val)`, target `θ₀ = θ`, bilinear seminorms (L²(P_X) of the
  nuisance differences), and Jacobian `J₀ = −E[(D − m_val(X))²]`.
* `integral_P_Z`, `plrMomentFunctional_factualZ` — change-of-variables bridges
  from the `P_Z`-level moment to the `μ`-level potential-outcome facts.

The three analytic facts that feed the DML engine live in sibling files:
`MeanZero.lean` (`plr_meanZero`, `plr_finite_var`) and `RemainderBound.lean`
(`plr_remainder_bound`, the doubly-robust product-rate bound).

/-! # Partially linear DML estimation system

This file provides the value-space estimation system carrying the regression
representatives, the joint observed-data law, and the `GeneralMoment` instance of
the abstract DML framework. The main declarations are `PLRSystem`,
`PLRSystem.factualZ`, `PLRSystem.P_Z`, `PLRSystem.P_X`, `PLRSystem.η₀`,
`PLRSystem.θ₀`, `PLRSystem.residSecondMoment`, `PLRSystem.plrGeneralMoment`, and
the change-of-variables helper `PLRSystem.integral_P_Z`. The resulting partially
linear moment has a DGP-dependent Jacobian equal to minus the residual treatment
variance; sibling files prove the mean-zero, finite-variance, score-L², and
doubly-robust remainder facts used for structural-slope DML normality. -/

/-- A partially linear estimation system extends a partially linear causal model with
value-space regression representatives — [an outcome-regression representative](hyp:lVal)
and [a treatment-regression representative](hyp:mVal) on the covariates — subject to:
each representative is [measurable](hyp:lVal_meas,mVal_meas); [the outcome representative
agrees almost surely with the conditional mean of the outcome given the covariates](hyp:lVal_compat)
and [the treatment representative agrees almost surely with the conditional mean of the
treatment given the covariates](hyp:mVal_compat); and [the treatment retains nonzero
variation after partialling out the covariate](hyp:nondegenerate), which is what makes the
partialling-out Jacobian invertible.

The representatives are the nuisance functions estimated by machine learning;
their compatibility fields tie them to the conditional expectations of outcome
and treatment given covariates. -/
