# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: the two-point reduction

This is the abstract reduction layer for the structure-agnostic optimality lower
bound (Jin–Syrgkanis 2024).  It packages a **two-point (Le Cam) witness** and
turns it into a minimax lower bound on the worst-case-over-class probability of
missing the true ATE.

A `TwoPointWitness` provides two `n`-sample data laws `Q false`, `Q true` together
with the data needed to run Le Cam's method:

* `θ` — the true ATE attached to each hypothesis, with a separation `2 s ≤ |θ true − θ false|`;
* `tvBound` — the total-variation distance between the two laws is `≤ c < 1`;
* `dominated` — the **realizability** obligation: each `(Q j)`-probability of missing
  `θ j` by `s` is dominated by the in-class minimax miss probability.  This is what a
  concrete construction discharges by writing `Q j` as a mixture of `n`-fold product
  laws of DGPs in the class, all sharing ATE `θ j` (so an average is `≤` the supremum).

Given such a witness, `twoPointWitness_lower_bound` concludes

  `(1 − c) / 2 ≤ minimaxMiss …`,

via `Causalean.Stat.two_point_lower_bound_of_tvDist_le`.  In particular a witness with
`c ≤ 1/2` forces every estimator to miss the truth by `s` with probability `≥ 1/4`
somewhere in the class (`twoPointWitness_quarter`).

The construction of an explicit witness with `s ≍ √εg · √εm` (the doubly-robust
product rate) and `c ≤ 1/2` in the regime `n · εg · εm ≲ 1` is the genuine
research content of the paper (the Ingster χ² / fuzzy-hypothesis step); this file
is correct regardless of how the witness is built.

/-! # Two-Point Reduction

This file defines the abstract two-point witness used in structure-agnostic ATE lower bounds.
It turns a pair of statistically close sample laws with separated ATEs and in-class
realizability into a minimax lower bound for the worst-case probability of estimator error.

The structure `TwoPointWitness` packages the two sample laws, their ATE labels, a separation
half-scale, a total-variation budget, and the domination condition connecting each witness law to
`minimaxMiss`.  The theorem `twoPointWitness_lower_bound` gives the Le Cam lower bound
`(1 - c) / 2`, and `twoPointWitness_quarter` specializes it to the common `c ≤ 1/2` case used by
the explicit minimax constructions. -/

/-- **Two-point (Le Cam) witness** for the structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: it bundles two
`n`-sample data laws, indexed by a hypothesis label `j : Bool`, together with the data needed
to run Le Cam's two-point method. For each hypothesis, [`Q j` is a probability
measure](hyp:Q,prob) with [true average treatment effect `θ j`](hyp:θ); the two hypotheses'
ATE values are [separated by at least twice the half-scale `s`](hyp:sep), while
[the total-variation distance between the two laws is bounded by `c`](hyp:tvBound), and
[for every estimator the probability under `Q j` of missing `θ j` by `s` is dominated by the
in-class minimax miss probability](hyp:dominated) — the realizability condition that a
mixture-of-in-class-DGPs construction discharges. -/
