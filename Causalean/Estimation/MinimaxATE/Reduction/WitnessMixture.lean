# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: the mixture two-point reduction (one-sided)

This is the **general** mixture form of the Le Cam two-point reduction, sharper
than `Witness.TwoPointWitness` in one decisive way: it only requires a *per-component
one-sided separation* of the ATE, `2 s ≤ |ate g₀ − ate (glam i)|` for each `i`, rather
than every alternative DGP sharing one common ATE value.  This is exactly what the
**functional / cell-varying center** construction needs (Jin–Syrgkanis 2024, Case 1
with arbitrary bounded `(m̂, ĝ)`): there the perturbed ATE is only a λ-independent
*lower bound* `ate (glam) ≥ ate (ĝ) + 2 s` (obtained from a Taylor expansion whose
first-order term cancels), not an exact constant.

Given
* a null in-class DGP `(m₀, g₀)` (typically the center `(m̂, ĝ)` itself);
* a finite family of in-class alternatives `(mlam i, glam i)` with weights `w` summing to `1`;
* per-component separation `2 s ≤ |ate g₀ − ate (glam i)|`;
* a total-variation budget `tvDist Q₀ Qmix ≤ c` between the null `n`-fold law and the
  weighted mixture of the alternatives' `n`-fold laws,

`mixture_two_point_lower_bound` concludes `(1 − c)/2 ≤ minimaxMiss …`.

The proof is the asymmetric testing argument: with `A` the null miss region, the
testing bound gives `1 − tvDist ≤ Q₀ A + Qmix Aᶜ`; the null side is `≤ minimaxMiss`
directly, and on `Aᶜ` the triangle inequality forces each component into *its own*
miss region (at `ate (glam i)`), so `Qmix Aᶜ ≤ minimaxMiss` by mixture domination.
Crucially the alternative side is measured at each component's true ATE — never at a
shared value — which is why a one-sided per-component bound suffices.

/-! # Mixture Two-Point Reduction

This file proves a mixture version of the two-point lower-bound argument for structure-agnostic
average-treatment-effect estimation.  It handles a null in-class DGP and a finite weighted family
of in-class alternatives whose treatment effects are each separated from the null, without
requiring the alternatives to share one common ATE.

The main theorem `mixture_two_point_lower_bound` combines the total-variation testing inequality
with `mixtureReal_le` and `nMiss_le_minimaxMiss`: the null miss event is dominated directly, while
the complement of the null miss event is contained in each alternative's own miss event by the
per-component separation. -/

/-- **Mixture two-point lower bound (one-sided separation).** Suppose [a null data-generating
process `(m₀, g₀)` lies in the structure-agnostic nuisance class](hyp:hnull) and [a finite
family of alternative data-generating processes `(mlam i, glam i)` also lie in the
class](hyp:hin), with [nonnegative mixture weights `w` summing to `1`](hyp:w,hw), where [every
alternative's average treatment effect is at least `2s` away from the null's](hyp:hsep), and
[the null's `n`-sample law and the weighted mixture of the alternatives' `n`-sample laws are at
total-variation distance at most `c`](hyp:htv). Then for [any measurable estimator of the
average treatment effect](hyp:hest), [the worst-case-over-class probability that it misses the
true ATE by `s` is at least `(1 − c)/2`](goal). Unlike `TwoPointWitness`, the alternatives need
not share a common ATE — only `2 s ≤ |ate g₀ − ate (glam i)|` per component. -/
