# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: the expected-risk (MSE) form

The paper (Jin–Syrgkanis 2024) states its minimax lower bound in the **quantile**
form (the `(1−γ)`-quantile of the squared error, eq. for `𝔐ⁿ,γ`), which is
exactly the probability-of-miss bound `minimax_lower_bound`
(`1/4 ≤ minimaxMiss …` is the case `γ = 3/4`).  The paper notes this quantile bound
is *stronger* than, and **implies**, the expected-risk (MSE) lower bound used by
Balakrishnan et al.: `𝔐ⁿ,γ ≥ ρ ⟹` minimax `𝔼`-risk `≥ (1−γ)ρ`.

This file makes that implication explicit and mechanical via the Chebyshev/Markov
bridge `nMiss_sq_le_nMSE`: every estimator has mean-squared error at least
`s²/4` on **some** in-class DGP, where `s = β(α+β)/(1−4β²)` is the
construction's perturbation-dependent separation.

The witness DGP is extracted from the two-point bound `1/4 ≤ max(…)`: either the
null estimate `(m̂, ĝ)` itself (left branch) or a single Rademacher-perturbed DGP
(right branch, pulled out of the uniform mixture `Qtrue` by `exists_real_ge_mixture`,
since a finite average is `≤` its maximal component).

/-! # Mean-Squared-Error Lower Bound

This file converts the structure-agnostic average treatment effect lower bound from a
probability-of-miss statement into an expected mean-squared-error statement. The theorem
`minimax_lower_bound_mse` combines `minimax_lower_bound` with the Chebyshev bridge
`nMiss_sq_le_nMSE` and extracts a single in-class witness DGP from either the null law or the
uniform perturbed mixture.

The result gives an expected-risk lower bound at the construction's caller-supplied
perturbation scale. That scale may be zero, and the theorem does not select it from the
nuisance budgets. -/

/-- **Structure-agnostic minimax lower bound, expected-risk (MSE) form.** Fix [nonnegative bump
magnitudes α and β with `α + 2β ≤ 1/2`](hyp:hα,hβ,hαβ) meeting [the Rademacher perturbation
budgets `β² ≤ εm` and `(α+β)²/(1−2β)² ≤ εg`](hyp:hm,hg) for [nonnegative error tolerances
εg, εm](hyp:hεg,hεm), in [the sample-size regime `2n²γ² ≤ K·log 2` with `γ = α²+2αβ+3β²` and
`2γ ≤ 1`](hyp:hγ,hreg). Then for [any measurable estimator of the average treatment
effect](hyp:hest), [there is a data-generating process in the structure-agnostic nuisance class
on which its mean-squared error is at least `s²/4`, with the displayed separation
`s = β(α+β)/(1−4β²)`](goal). This is the weaker, `(1−γ)`-factored consequence
(`γ = 3/4`) of the quantile bound, in
the form used by Balakrishnan et al. -/
