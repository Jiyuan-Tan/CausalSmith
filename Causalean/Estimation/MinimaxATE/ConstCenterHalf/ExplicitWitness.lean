# Structure-agnostic ATE lower bound: assembling the explicit two-point witness

This file assembles the explicit Case-1 construction (`Construction.lean`,
`Membership.lean`, `Gap.lean`) into a `TwoPointWitness` and the resulting minimax
lower bound, with the two i.i.d. data laws

* `Qfalse = P̂^⊗n` — the `n`-sample law of the null estimate `(m̂, ĝ) = (1/2, 1/2)`;
* `Qtrue  = (1/2^K) Σ_λ Qλ^⊗n` — the **uniform mixture** over Rademacher signs
  `λ : Fin K → Bool` of the perturbed laws (`mixture` from `Stat/Minimax`).

The `dominated` (realizability) obligation is discharged by `mixtureReal_le`: every
perturbed DGP lies in the class (`inClass_perturbed`) and shares the **same** ATE
`θ_true = 2β(α+β)/(1−4β²)` (`ate_gPerturbed`, independent of `λ`), so an average of
in-class miss probabilities is at most their supremum `minimaxMiss`; the null law is
itself in-class with ATE `0`.

The only remaining input is the **statistical indistinguishability** of the two
laws, `tvDist Qfalse Qtrue ≤ 1/2` (the Ingster χ² / Hellinger second-moment bound of
the paper, valid in the regime `n · εg · εm ≲ 1`).  Here it is carried as an explicit
hypothesis `htv`; the sibling χ²-core file discharges it.  Given it,
`explicit_minimax_lower_bound` concludes that **no** estimator can be within
`s = β(α+β)/(1−4β²) ≍ √(εg·εm)` of the true ATE with probability `> 3/4` uniformly
over the class — the doubly-robust product rate is unbeatable.

/-! # Explicit Two-Point Witness

This file builds the baseline finite two-point witness for the structure-agnostic ATE lower
bound. It defines the centered null law `Qfalse`, the uniform sign weights `signWeight`, the
sign-indexed perturbed laws `Qpert`, and the mixed alternative `Qtrue`, together with their
probability-measure lemmas.

The helper `real_le_minimaxMiss` relates any in-class DGP's miss probability to the minimax
miss functional. The construction `explicitWitness` packages the null and mixed alternative
into a `TwoPointWitness` under a supplied total-variation bound, and
`explicit_minimax_lower_bound` turns that witness into the conditional finite-cell minimax lower
bound used by the chi-squared core. -/
