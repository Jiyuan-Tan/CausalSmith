# Example: Real-Valued Backdoor Adjustment Skeleton

End-to-end typeclass and graph validation of the kernel-native backdoor pipeline
on an SCM whose observed value spaces are all `ℝ`. The concrete structural
functions below are deterministic constants, so the induced observed law is
degenerate; the example does not prove overlap or positivity and supplies those
analytic conditions as hypotheses in the identification theorem.

## The SCM

Three observed nodes indexed by `Fin 3`:

* `0 ↦ Z` — the confounder (continuous, ℝ-valued)
* `1 ↦ X` — the treatment (continuous, ℝ-valued)
* `2 ↦ Y` — the outcome  (continuous, ℝ-valued)

Edges: `Z → X`, `Z → Y`, `X → Y` — i.e. `Z` is a backdoor-admissible confounder.

The structural functions are deterministic (latent set is empty) and constant
`0`; the file uses this degenerate model to exercise the real-valued
measurability and graphical bookkeeping with minimal analytic overhead.

## What this validates

* The SCM construction (`continuousBackdoorSCM`) type-checks on `ℝ`-valued
  spaces.  The kernel-native backdoor pipeline does *not* require value-type
  countability or finiteness.
* `SWIGGraph.backdoorCriterion` discharges via `decide` on the
  underlying DAG (`cb_backdoor_criterion`), witnessing that the continuous SCM
  admits the backdoor adjustment set `{Z}`.
* `cb_backdoor_identified` applies the general a.e. backdoor pipeline on this
  concrete continuous-treatment graph once the overlap and positivity
  hypotheses are supplied.

/-! # Real-Valued Backdoor Example

This file gives a real-valued backdoor example in which the confounder,
treatment, and outcome all take values in `ℝ`. The declarations `CBNode`,
`CBΩ`, `cbDAG`, `cbSWIGGraph`, and `continuousBackdoorSCM` build a degenerate
constant structural model whose purpose is to exercise the real-valued graph and
kernel interfaces. The theorem `cb_backdoor_criterion` verifies the graphical
backdoor criterion by computation, and `cb_backdoor_identified` applies the
kernel-based backdoor pipeline once the required overlap and positivity
conditions are supplied as hypotheses.
