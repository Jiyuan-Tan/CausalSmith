/-! # Sharpness certificates for graphical partial-identification bounds

For a graphical partial-identification problem, a valid bound `[L, U]` on a real-valued causal
query is **sharp** when the identified set — the range of the query over the compatible class
of structural causal models — is exactly `[L, U]`. Sharpness is *preferred but not required*:
a valid relaxed bound stands on its own; a sharpness claim must additionally exhibit compatible
models attaining each endpoint.

This file records the sharpness predicate and the standard **certificate**: if the identified
set is order-convex, lies inside `[L, U]` (soundness), and the endpoints `L` and `U` are each
attained by some compatible model, then the bound is sharp. The order-convexity hypothesis is
the usual mixing-path input (a continuous family of compatible models interpolating the query
value); it is left as a hypothesis so the certificate applies to any problem that supplies it.

/-- For a finite node set with measurable node-value spaces, [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [a class of
structural causal models](hyp:As), [a baseline structural causal model](hyp:M₀), [a real-valued
query of such models](hyp:obj), and [two real numbers $L$ and $U$](hyp:L,U), [the sharpness
predicate](goal) holds exactly when the query's range over models compatible with the graph,
class, and baseline model is the closed interval $[L,U]$.

A bound `[L, U]` is **sharp** for the real-valued query `obj` over the compatible class of
`(G, As, M₀)` when the identified set (the range of `obj` over the compatible class) is exactly
the closed interval `[L, U]`. -/
