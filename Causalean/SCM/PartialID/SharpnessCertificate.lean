/-! # Sharpness certificates for graphical partial-identification bounds

For a graphical partial-identification problem, a valid bound `[L, U]` on a real-valued causal
query is **sharp** when the identified set — the range of the query over the compatible class
of structural causal models — is exactly `[L, U]`. Sharpness is *preferred but not required*:
a valid relaxed bound stands on its own; a sharpness claim must additionally exhibit compatible
models attaining each endpoint.

This file records the sharpness predicate and the standard **certificate**: if the identified
set is order-convex, lies inside `[L, U]` (soundness), and the endpoints `L` and `U` are each
attained by some compatible model, then the bound is sharp. The order-convexity hypothesis is
the usual mixing-path input (a continuous family of compatible models interpolating the query
value); it is left as a hypothesis so the certificate applies to any problem that supplies it.

A bound `[L, U]` is **sharp** for the real-valued query `obj` over the compatible class of

the closed interval `[L, U]`. -/
