/-! # Compatible structural causal models for graphical partial identification

This file provides the object over which graphical **partial identification** quantifies:
the class of structural causal models that share a given causal diagram, satisfy stated
structural assumptions, and reproduce a reference observational law. A bound on a causal
query is *sound* when every model in this class satisfies it, and the resulting identified
set is the range of the query over the class.

Concretely, fixing a SWIG graph `G`, a structural-assumption predicate `As`, and a reference
model `M₀`, the **compatible class** collects the models `M` that (i) have diagram `G`, (ii)
satisfy `As`, and (iii) are observationally equivalent to `M₀` (same derived observational
kernel). The **compatible interval** of a real-valued query is the range of that query over
the compatible class — an instance of the abstract `IdentifiedInterval` from the
potential-outcomes partial-identification layer, so the existing sharpness / order-convexity
lemmas apply.

## Finite response-function reduction

The finite canonical response-function *reduction* says that every measure-theoretic model in
the compatible class is behaviourally matched by a model over a finite exogenous domain
(Zhang–Tian–Bareinboim). It is not included here: the Causalean SCM layer is
measure-theoretic (`Causalean.SCM` carries `MeasureTheory.Measure` latents), so this reduction
is a genuine theorem, not a definitional unfolding. It is needed only when a *sharpness* claim
must be discharged by enumerating finitely many realising models; soundness of a bound does not
require it. The only finite realisation currently in the library is the Balke–Pearl construction
in the potential-outcomes framework
(`Causalean/PO/ID/Partial/BalkePearl/`).

/-- For [a finite collection of distinguishable node labels with measurable
value spaces](hyp:N), [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [a predicate specifying structural assumptions](hyp:As),
and [a reference structural causal model](hyp:M₀), the [compatible-model class](goal)
is the collection of structural causal models that [have the given graph](step:1),
satisfy the given assumptions, and are observationally equivalent to
the reference model.

The **compatible class** for a graphical partial-identification problem: the structural
causal models `M` that share the SWIG graph `G`, satisfy the structural assumptions `As`, and
are observationally equivalent to the reference model `M₀` (their derived observational
kernels agree). This is the class over which a bound must hold to be *sound*. -/

satisfying `As'` also satisfies `As`](hyp:h), then [every model compatible with the reference

`As`](goal) — strengthening the structural assumptions can only shrink the compatible class. -/

value spaces](hyp:N), [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [a predicate specifying structural assumptions](hyp:As),
[a reference structural causal model](hyp:M₀), and [a real-valued causal query](hyp:obj),
the [compatible interval](goal) is the set of all query values attained by
structural causal models compatible with that graph, assumptions, and reference model.

The **compatible interval** of a real-valued causal query: its range over the compatible
class. This is the graphical identified set; a partial-identification bound `[L, U]` is *sound*
exactly when this set is contained in `Set.Icc L U`, and *sharp* when they are equal. Built on
the abstract `IdentifiedInterval`, so the order-convexity / sharpness lemmas of the
partial-identification layer apply. -/
