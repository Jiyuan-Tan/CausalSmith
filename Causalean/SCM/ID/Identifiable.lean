# Identifiability of Causal Effects

This file defines causal queries and identifiability, stated against the
SCM-primitive model (`Causalean.SCM`) and the derived observational kernel
`Causalean.SCM.obsKernel`.

## Main definitions

* `CausalQuery` — a functional of a causal model (Definition 9 from tex)
* `Identifiable` — a causal query is identifiable if same observational
  distribution implies same query value (Definition 10 from tex)
* `NonIdentifiable` — negation of identifiability
* `IdentifiableUnder` — identifiability given additional functional and
  structural assumptions

## Design notes

`IdentifiableUnder` takes two assumption predicates separately, matching the
separation in Basic Concepts.tex:
- `Af : SCM N Ω → Prop` — functional assumptions (edge type constraints)
- `As : SCM N Ω → Prop` — structural assumptions (distributional constraints:
  IV, DID, RDD, proxy, etc.)

Two SCMs are declared observationally equivalent when they share the same DAG
and their `obsKernel`s are equal as `ProbabilityTheory.Kernel`s.  Because the
kernel types depend on `M.fixed` / `M.observed` (through `FixedValues` and
`ObservedValues`), equality is expressed via `HEq` to tolerate the dependent
types; when the two models share the same DAG the value spaces coincide but
Lean will not always see this definitionally.

/-! # Identifiability

This file defines the query-level interface used by SCM identification theorems.
`CausalQuery` is a functional of an SCM, `obsEquiv` compares observational
kernels with heterogeneous equality, `Identifiable` and `NonIdentifiable` express
whether a query is a functional of the observational law on a fixed SWIG graph,
and `IdentifiableUnder` adds functional and structural assumption predicates.
The helper theorems expose witness-based non-identifiability and monotonicity
under stronger assumptions. -/

-- Causal Queries

/-- For [a finite set of node labels](hyp:N), [measurable value spaces assigned to
    those nodes](hyp:Ω), and [a result space](hyp:α), [a causal query](goal) maps
    each structural causal model on those nodes to one value in the result space.

    From the tex: "A causal query is a functional Φ of the counterfactual
    distribution, e.g., Φ(C) = P(Y(x)) or Φ(C) = E[Y(x)] - E[Y(x')]."

    Examples:
    - ATE: Φ(C) = E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]
    - LATE: Φ(C) = E[Y(1) - Y(0) | complier]
    - Interventional distribution: Φ(C) = P(Y(x)) as a Measure

    The type parameter Ω assigns measurable value spaces to nodes; α is the
    result type. -/

/-- For [a finite node-label set](hyp:N), [measurable node-value spaces](hyp:Ω),
    and [two structural causal models](hyp:M₁,M₂) on them, [observational equivalence](goal)
    means that their derived observational probability kernels are equal.

    Because `obsKernel` has dependent domain/codomain
    (`FixedValues M` and `ObservedValues M`), we use `HEq` to accommodate two
    models whose `fixed`/`observed` sets may only be propositionally equal. -/

/-- For [a finite node-label set](hyp:N), [measurable node-value spaces](hyp:Ω),
    [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), and [a causal query](hyp:Φ), [identifiability](goal)
    means that every pair of structural causal models whose SWIG graphs both equal
    the given graph and whose observational probability kernels are equal has the
    same query value.

    From the tex (`def:scm-identifiability`):
    "Let ℱ be a class of gSCMs **sharing a SWIG graph 𝒢** … A causal query Φ is
    identifiable if, for all 𝓜₁, 𝓜₂ ∈ ℱ, P_obs = P_obs ⟹ Φ(𝓜₁) = Φ(𝓜₂)."

    The model class is pinned by the full SWIG graph `G` (which fixes the
    observed / latent / fixed node partition and the edges), not merely the
    underlying DAG: the observed/latent/fixed split is part of the causal
    diagram and is not recoverable from `dag` alone.  Equivalently, Φ is
    identifiable if it is a functional of P_obs alone. -/

/-- For [a finite node-label set](hyp:N), [measurable node-value spaces](hyp:Ω),
    [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), and [a causal query](hyp:Φ), [non-identifiability](goal)
    means that the query is not identifiable from the observational distribution:
    it is not the case that every two models with that graph and equal
    observational probability kernels have equal query values.

    A witness for non-identifiability consists of two models C₁, C₂ such that
    P_obs^{C₁} = P_obs^{C₂} but Φ(C₁) ≠ Φ(C₂). -/

    [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [a functional-assumption predicate](hyp:Af), [a
    structural-assumption predicate](hyp:As), and [a causal query](hyp:Φ),
    [identifiability under the two assumptions](goal) means that every pair of
    models whose SWIG graphs equal the given graph, which both satisfy each
    predicate, and which have equal observational probability kernels, has the
    same query value.

    `Af` encodes *functional assumptions* on edge types (nonparametric,
    monotonic, linear).
    `As` encodes *structural assumptions* (IV, DID, RDD, proxy variable
    conditions).
    Both are plain `Prop`-valued predicates over causal models; the
    distinction is conceptual.  Concrete structural assumptions are supplied by
    the identification theorem or downstream module that needs them. -/

    `Af₁`](hyp:hf), [every model satisfying `As₂` also satisfies `As₁`](hyp:hs), and [`Φ` is
    identifiable under the assumption pair `(Af₁, As₁)`](hyp:h_id), then [`Φ` is identifiable under
