/-! # The recursive IDENTIFY certificate (full Tian–Shpitser ID success)

The no-fixing certificate `cFactorReachable` (in `DoGFormula`) only handles the
case where a required district is already a full c-component of the original
graph.  The full ID algorithm recovers a target c-factor `Q[C]` from the c-factor
`Q[T]` of its containing district `T` by Tian's IDENTIFY subroutine
(Shpitser–Pearl, Fig. 3): repeatedly restrict to the ancestral set of `C` and
descend into the c-component of `C` in that restriction.

This file encodes IDENTIFY as an **inductive reachability predicate**
`CFactorReachableRec G T C` — a derivation exists iff `identify(C, T, ·)` returns
successfully (no hedge).  Using an inductive predicate (rather than a
`termination_by` recursion) makes the downstream soundness proof a clean
induction on the derivation, and makes well-foundedness structural.

* `inducedAncestral G T C` — the observed ancestors of `C` within the subgraph of
  `G` induced on `T` (Tian's `An(C)_{G_T}`, the observed part).
* `CFactorReachableRec G T C` — the IDENTIFY success predicate.
* `cFactorReachable_base_toRec` / `idSucceeds_toRec` — the no-fixing certificate is
  the base case, so `idSucceedsRec` generalizes `idSucceeds` (and the recursive
  soundness `id_sound_rec` will subsume the no-fixing `id_sound`).

/-- For [a finite collection of distinguishable node labels](hyp:N),
[a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [a node set on which to induce a subgraph](hyp:T),
and [a target node set](hyp:C), the [induced ancestral set](goal) is the observed
part of the ancestors of the target set in the graph induced on the first set.

**Observed ancestors of `C` within the subgraph induced on `T`.**  Tian's
`An(C)_{G_T}`: restrict `G` to the node set `T`, take the ancestors of `C` in that
restricted graph, and keep the observed nodes.  This is the set the IDENTIFY
subroutine compares against `C` (project) and `T` (hedge / fail). -/

/-- For [a finite collection of distinguishable node labels](hyp:N) and [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [the recursive c-factor reachability relation](goal) relates any source node set $T$ to any target node set $C$ when either [the target is nonempty, is contained in the source, and its observed ancestral set in the source-induced graph is exactly the target](hyp:base), or [the target is nonempty and contained in the source, that ancestral set is neither the target nor the source, and the target is recursively reachable from its containing c-component in the ancestral induced graph](hyp:step).

**Recursive IDENTIFY reachability (full Tian–Shpitser success certificate).**
`CFactorReachableRec G T C` holds when `identify(C, T, Q[T])` succeeds, i.e. the
c-factor `Q[C]` is recoverable from `Q[T]`.

* `base`: `An(C)_{G_T} = C`, so `Q[C]` is the marginal `∑_{T∖C} Q[T]` — no further
  fixing needed.  (This subsumes the no-fixing case, where `T = C`.)
* `step`: `An(C)_{G_T}` is a proper intermediate set `A` (neither `C` nor `T`; the
  `A = T` case is the hedge, which is *absent* here — no constructor), and IDENTIFY
  recurses on the c-component of `C` inside `G_A`, a strictly smaller district. -/

/-- For [a finite collection of distinguishable node labels](hyp:N),
[an intervention variable set](hyp:X), [an outcome-node set](hyp:Y), and
[a SWIG graph](hyp:G), the [full recursive ID success certificate](goal) holds
exactly when [the intervention set is valid for the graph](step:1), the outcome
nodes are observed, no random counterpart of an intervention variable
is an outcome node, and every district of the post-intervention
ancestral graph is recursively reachable from its containing district in the
original graph.

**Full recursive success certificate for the ID algorithm.**  As `idSucceeds`,
but each c-component `S` of the post-intervention ancestral graph need only be
*recursively reachable* from its containing district (`CFactorReachableRec`), not
already a full c-component.  This is the honest Tian–Shpitser ID success
condition (for the soundness direction). -/
