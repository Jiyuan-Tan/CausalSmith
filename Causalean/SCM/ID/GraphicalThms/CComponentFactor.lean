# C-Component Chain-Rule Factorization (Tian, 2002)

Formalizes `thm:scm-c-factor` (Basic Concepts.tex:662–672) against the
SCM-primitive observational kernel.  This file keeps Tian's c-component
factor definitions and records the continuous-safe per-node chain-rule form
currently used as the foundational factorization:

    P(v) = ∏_{i} P(V_i | V_0, ..., V_{i-1})

where the observed nodes are ordered topologically and Tian's
`Pa⁺(V_i)` is the full observed history before `V_i`.

The component-specific factors remain available as conditional kernels:

    Q_j (C_j | ·) = ∏_{V ∈ C_j} P(V | Pa⁺_G(V)).

Here `Pa⁺_G(V)` denotes the *observed predecessors* of `V` in a fixed
topological order — Tian's "history up to V" convention.

## Main definitions

* `SWIGGraph.qFactorParents C` — `(⋃ v ∈ C, Pa⁺_G(v)) \ C`: the
  conditioning set used by the current kernel-level proxy for `Q[C]`.
* `SCM.qFactor M C s` — the current conditional-kernel representation,
  `P(C | qFactorParents C)` at fixed slice `s`.  The Tian c-factor product
  interpretation requires a separate bridge; it is not definitional from this
  declaration alone.

## Main statement

* `c_component_factorization` — `obsKernel M s = M.qFactorProduct s`,
  the per-node chain-rule product over observed variables.  Grouping this
  product into c-components is the next theorem layer.

# C-Component Factorization

This file develops Tian's c-component factor setup for structural causal models
and connects it to the per-node observational chain-rule product.

The public API names the conditioning set for a component factor,
`SWIGGraph.qFactorParents C = (⋃ v ∈ C, Pa⁺_G(v)) \ C`, proves that these
conditioning coordinates are observed, and defines `SCM.qFactor M C s` as the
conditional-kernel proxy for `Q[C]` at a fixed slice.  The theorem
`c_component_factorization` records the continuous-safe foundation: the
observational kernel is the chain-rule product of one-node conditional kernels
along the topological order of observed nodes.

Grouping that chain-rule product into Tian c-component factors is theorem
content supplied by downstream density and q-factor identity files; it is not a
definitional property of `qFactor`.

/-- For [a SWIG graph](hyp:G) and [a finite set of its vertices](hyp:C), the
    [conditioning-parent set](goal) is the union of the graph's observed
    predecessors of the vertices in that set, with the set itself removed.

    This is the conditioning set of the c-component factor $Q[C]$.  Its
    members are observed predecessors of a vertex in the set that are not

/-- For [a structural causal model](hyp:M), [a finite set of observed SWIG
    vertices](hyp:C), and [a fixed-value assignment](hyp:s), provided
    [that the vertex set is contained in the observed-node set](hyp:hC) and
    that the value space of that vertex set is standard Borel and nonempty,
    every observational distribution at a fixed-value assignment is finite,
    and either the fixed-value space is countable or the conditioning-value
    space has a countably generated σ-algebra, the [c-component
    conditional kernel](goal) is the conditional law of the values on the
    vertex set given the values on its conditioning-parent set under the
    model's observational law at that fixed-value assignment.

    The standard Tian c-factor `Q[C]` is the product over the prefix factors
    belonging to `C`, and Eq. 13 identifies that product with a do-complement
    law for a full c-component.  Those identifications are theorem content, not
    consequences of this definition by unfolding. -/

/-- **Theorem (Tian 2002, per-node chain-rule factorization).** [For a structural causal model
    `M`](hyp:M), [at a fixed assignment `s`](hyp:s), [its observational kernel equals the full
    chain-rule product of one-node conditional kernels along the topological order of observed
    nodes](goal). Tian's `Pa⁺(V)` is interpreted as the full observed history before `V`,
    so this statement is the ordinary iterated-disintegration factorization and
    does not use graphical Markov or do-calculus reasoning.

    The subsequent c-component grouping theorem should collect these per-node
    factors according to the c-components of `M.toSWIGGraph`. -/
