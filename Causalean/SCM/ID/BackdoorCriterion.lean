# Backdoor-style graph clauses and Rule-3 leg (shared plumbing)

The graph predicate here records the two ancestry and d-separation clauses that
the backdoor identification proof consumes, together with the
regime-independent do-calculus Rule-3 leg.  The identification *theorems*
themselves live in `Causalean/SCM/ID/Backdoor.lean`
(`backdoor_completeness_ae`, `backdoor_identifiable_ae`); this file holds only
the graph predicate and the shared Rule-3 marginal-invariance leg.

* `SWIGGraph.backdoorCriterion` — the standard adjustment-set predicate
  (definition).
* `backdoor_rule3_Z_marginal` — under criterion (i), the `Z`-marginal of the
  intervened observational kernel equals that of the base kernel (Rule 3 leg).

## Main definitions

* `SWIGGraph.backdoorCriterion G X hX_obs hX_fix Y Z` — the standard
  adjustment predicate: `Z` is observed, excludes the outcome and treatment
  random nodes, contains no descendant of a treatment random node, and
  d-separates `Y` from `X.image .random` in the splitMono graph
  `G.splitMono X hX_obs hX_fix`, which encodes the lower-bar mutilation
  `G_{X̲}` (outgoing edges of `random D` for `D ∈ X` rerouted to
  `fixed D`, making them graph roots with respect to the random copies).

## Design note

The lower-bar mutilation `G_{X̲}` deletes outgoing edges of `X.image .random`.
In the SWIG split (`SWIGGraph.splitMono`), exactly those outgoing edges are
rerouted to `fixed D` nodes, which are roots, so d-separation in the splitMono
graph gives the criterion needed by the SCM do-calculus rules without a
separate mutilated-graph construction.

# Backdoor criterion and Rule 3 marginal leg

This file defines the SWIG backdoor criterion used by SCM backdoor
identification and proves the Rule 3 marginal-invariance step for the adjustment
set.  The full backdoor completeness and identifiability theorems live in
`Causalean/SCM/ID/Backdoor.lean`; this module supplies their reusable graphical
criterion and the `Z`-marginal equality needed in the do-calculus assembly.

/-- Given [a SWIG graph](hyp:G), [a finite treatment-variable set $X$](hyp:X),
    [the condition that the random copy of every treatment variable is
    observed](hyp:hX_obs), [the condition that the fixed copy of no treatment
    variable is already fixed](hyp:hX_fix), [a finite outcome-vertex set
    $Y$](hyp:Y), and [a finite candidate adjustment-vertex set $Z$](hyp:Z),
    the [backdoor criterion](goal) holds precisely when [every vertex in $Z$
    is observed](step:1), [$Z$ is disjoint from $Y$](step:2), [$Z$ is disjoint
    from the random copies of the treatment variables](step:3), [no vertex in
    $Z$ is a descendant of a random treatment copy](step:4), and [in the graph
    obtained by splitting the treatment variables, $Y$ is d-separated from
    their random copies after conditioning on $Z$ and their fixed
    copies](step:5).

    Splitting reroutes outgoing edges of each random treatment copy to its
    fixed copy, thereby encoding the lower-bar mutilation graph.  The fixed
    copies are included in the conditioning set to match the Rule 2 contract.

/-- **Backdoor Rule-3 leg.** Fix a causal model `M` and a treatment set `X` [whose random copy
    is observed and whose fixed copy is not already held fixed in `M`](hyp:hX_obs,hX_fixed),
    and a set `Z` [that is observed in `M`](hyp:hZ) such that [no node of `Z` is a descendant
    of any treatment random node](hyp:h_crit_i) — the non-descendant clause of the backdoor
    criterion. Then, at any post-intervention configuration `s_post`, [the `Z`-marginal of the
    post-intervention observational law at `s_post` equals the `Z`-marginal of the original
    observational law at the pre-intervention configuration underlying `s_post`](goal).

    Proof: direct application of `SCM.do_rule3` with `Y_param := ∅`,
    `W_param := Z`.  Criterion (i) composes with
    `SCM.fixSet_isAncestor_fixed_forward` (Phase 1A) to supply Rule 3's
    `hNoDesc` hypothesis on the post-intervention graph. -/
