/-! # The counting reference measure for finite discrete models

On finite node value spaces the canonical reference family is the per-node
counting measure.  It is faithful — every singleton has counting mass one — so,
via `absolutelyContinuous_jointRef_of_faithful`, *every* structural causal model
is dominated by it.  This supplies the domination half of the general
density-route identification theorem `id_sound`, whose model class is
`DominatedObs · ref ∧ DiscretePositive`; the positivity half is supplied by the
standard discrete positive model class.

/-- For any node set with measurable node-value spaces, provided every random or fixed node has
a countable value space and every base-node singleton is measurable, [the counting reference
family](goal) [assigns counting measure to every random and fixed node coordinate](step:1) and
records that each such measure is σ-finite.

The counting reference family: each SWIG-node coordinate carries the counting
