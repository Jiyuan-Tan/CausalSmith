/-! # Foundational helpers for the do-law Y-marginal

This file collects foundational facts used to identify the `Y`-marginal of the
do-law from observational densities.  It currently provides cross-model density
transport: two structural causal models sharing the same SWIG graph and the same
observational kernel also share the same observational density, so densities
transport across models that agree on those data.  This is the step that turns the
hypothesis "the two models have the same observational law" into "the two models
have the same observational density", from which the recovered c-factors — and
hence the identifiable do-law `Y`-marginal — are read off.

/-- **Cross-model density transport.** If [two structural causal models `M₁` and
`M₂` share the same SWIG graph](hyp:hsg) and [have heterogeneously-equal observational
kernels](hyp:hobs), then [their observational densities are heterogeneously
equal](goal).  After unifying the SWIG-graph data the observed-value types coincide, the
observational kernels become literally equal, and the density is the Radon–Nikodym
derivative of that kernel against a fixed reference measure. -/

/-- **Cross-model law transport (converse).** If [two structural causal models `M₁` and
`M₂` are each dominated by the same reference measure](hyp:hdom₁,hdom₂), [share the same
SWIG graph](hyp:hsg), and have [heterogeneously-equal observational densities](hyp:hden),
then [their observational kernels are heterogeneously equal](goal).  After unifying the
SWIG-graph data the observed-value types coincide and the densities become literally
equal; weighting the common joint reference by that density recovers each observational
law (`withDensity_obsDensity_eq`), so the two laws agree.  This is the converse of
`obsDensity_heq_of_obsKernel_heq`: under dominance, equal density and equal law are
interchangeable, letting the kernel-level identification tools be driven from a density
hypothesis. -/
