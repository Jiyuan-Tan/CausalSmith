/-! # Reference measure and joint observational density

A *reference measure family* assigns one σ-finite measure to every SWIG-node value
space: the counting measure for a discrete node, Lebesgue measure for a continuous
node, or any σ-finite choice.  Its finite product over a node set is the joint
reference measure, and a gSCM is *dominated* when its observational kernel is
absolutely continuous with respect to that joint reference.  In the dominated case
the observational law has a joint density (Radon–Nikodym derivative), and the law
is recovered from the density.

This is the foundation for the density-assisted c-component factorization: Tian's
assembly step `P(v) = ∏_C Q[C]` is a commutative regrouping of scalar density
factors, which has no kernel-composition analogue.  The downstream ID theorems in
this slice specialize these reference-measure definitions to finite node value
spaces with measurable singleton sets and faithful finite-product references.

/-- A reference measure family assigns [a measure on every random or fixed node's value

Take the counting measure on discrete nodes and Lebesgue measure on continuous
nodes; any sigma-finite choice is allowed. This is the dominating measure
against which observational densities are formed. -/

family](hyp:ref), and [a finite node set](hyp:I), [the joint reference measure](goal) is the
finite product of the reference measures assigned to the nodes in that set.

For counting references this is counting measure on the discrete product; for
Lebesgue references it is Lebesgue measure on the continuous product. -/

Equivalently, the observational law admits a joint density at every fixed-value

The cross-model determination used for soundness is assembled downstream, where
the shared graph equality lets the two laws be compared in one type. -/
