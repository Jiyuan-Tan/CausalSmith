/-! # Finite reference measures for discrete ID densities

When every node value space is finite with measurable singletons, the per-node
reference measures in a σ-finite reference family are finite.  Consequently the
finite products `jointRef ref I` are finite as well.  This file packages those
instances and the simple measurability fact used by the finite/discrete
chain-rule density proof.
