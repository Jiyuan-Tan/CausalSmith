# Rule 2 / backdoor overlap predicate

The kernel-level absolute-continuity (overlap) predicate consumed by the
kernel-native do-calculus Rule 2 and the backdoor / frontdoor identification
theorems.

## Main definition

* `Rule2JointOverlap M' Z hZ_obs hZ_fixed W hZrW s'` — the do-intervened
  model's `(Z.random ∪ W)`-marginal is absolutely continuous w.r.t. the base
  model's `(Z.random ∪ W)`-marginal.  Continuous-friendly: no pointwise
  singleton positivity is required.

## References

* Basic Concepts.tex, Definition 2.12 (overlap assumption); the quantitative
  small-value (weak-overlap) rate analysis — polynomial lower-tail inverse
  moments — is developed separately under `Stat/PolynomialTail/`.

/-! # Overlap

This file defines the kernel-level overlap condition used by do-calculus
identification rules. The main predicate, `Rule2JointOverlap`, requires the
post-intervention marginal on `Z.random ∪ W` to be absolutely continuous with
respect to the corresponding observational marginal. This continuous-friendly
support condition feeds the kernel-native Rule 2 and the backdoor/frontdoor
identification theorems without imposing pointwise singleton positivity. -/

/-- For [a finite node-label set](hyp:N), [measurable node-value spaces](hyp:Ω),
    [a structural causal model](hyp:M'), [an intervention target set](hyp:Z),
    [proof that each target is an observed random node not already fixed](hyp:hZ_obs,hZ_fixed),
    [an additional observed-node set](hyp:W), [proof that the random copies of
    the targets together with that set are observed](hyp:hZrW), and [a fixed-value
    assignment after intervention](hyp:s'), [Rule 2 joint overlap](goal) means
    that the post-intervention observational marginal on those nodes is absolutely
    continuous with respect to the corresponding pre-intervention observational
    marginal at the projected fixed-value assignment.

    A kernel-level absolute-continuity predicate with no pointwise
    singleton positivity requirement.  Holds trivially in the discrete
    case (the two marginals literally agree on the `Z.rand`-level set,
    cf. `obsKernel_inter_singleton_Zrand_eq`); holds in the continuous
    case whenever the SCM's structural functions are measurable and the
    latent measures match (`fixSet` only rewires structural fns at `Z`).

    Used by `obsCondKernel_fixSet_eq` (kernel-native Rule 2) and through
    it by `do_rule2_kernel` and the backdoor / frontdoor identification
    theorems. -/
