# Positivity assumptions for discrete ID formulas

The discrete ID lane uses ratio-based conditional masses.  This file records the
nonzero point-mass assumptions needed to make those ratios meaningful.  The
default model-level predicate is full observational support on every observed
assignment at every fixed slice; later formula-level soundness lemmas can weaken
it to only the denominators actually used by a concrete formula.

Important declarations are `PositiveMass`, `DiscretePositive`, and
`StandardDiscretePositive`, together with transport lemmas showing that positive
point mass is preserved by measurable surjections and coordinate projections.
These lemmas turn full observational support into the denominator positivity
needed by `conditionalMass`.
