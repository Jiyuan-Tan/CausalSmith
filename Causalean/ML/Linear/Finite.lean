/-! # Linear least squares — finite design-matrix layer

The ordinary-least-squares objective on a finite design matrix `X : Matrix Obs
Param ℝ` and its optimization property: any solution of the normal equations
`XᵀX β = Xᵀy` minimizes the sum of squared errors. The bridge theorem
`empiricalRisk_squaredLoss_linear` identifies the spine's `empiricalRisk`
(squared loss, linear-in-features predictor) with `(card)⁻¹` times this
objective, so finite OLS is a genuine ERM.
