/-! # Linear least squares — closed form

The structural closed-form content of OLS. This file defines `olsCoef`, proves
`ols_normalEq_of_minimizer` from global optimality, and shows that invertible
`XᵀX` makes the normal-equation solution unique with closed form
`β̂ = (XᵀX)⁻¹ Xᵀy`.

/-- For [a finite set of observations](hyp:Obs), [a finite coefficient index set whose equality
can be decided](hyp:Param),
[a design matrix](hyp:X), and [an outcome vector](hyp:y), the [closed-form ordinary
least-squares coefficient vector](goal) is the product of the totalized inverse of the design
matrix's cross-product matrix—equal to its ordinary inverse when that matrix is invertible—and
the design matrix transposed times the outcome vector. -/
