/-! # Fisher consistency of the logistic cross-entropy loss

The Bernoulli cross-entropy `bernoulliCE η q = −η log q − (1−η) log(1−q)` is
minimized over `q ∈ [0,1]` exactly at `q = η`.  This is the pointwise heart of
Fisher consistency: the population log-loss minimizer recovers the true
conditional probability `η(x) = P(Y = 1 ∣ X = x)`.

/-- For [a true success probability $\eta$](hyp:η) and [a predicted success probability $q$](hyp:q), the [Bernoulli cross-entropy](goal) is $-\eta\log q-(1-\eta)\log(1-q)$.

This pointwise loss underlies binary logistic prediction. -/
noncomputable def bernoulliCE (η q : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  -η * Real.log q - (1 - η) * Real.log (1 - q)

/-- For [a true probability `η` strictly between `0` and `1`](hyp:hη), [the Bernoulli
cross-entropy `q ↦ bernoulliCE η q` attains its minimum over the open interval `(0,1)` exactly at
the truth `q = η`](goal).

The interior is essential: Mathlib's junk convention `Real.log 0 = 0` makes the closed-interval
version false at the boundary, where the genuine cross-entropy is `+∞`. -/
