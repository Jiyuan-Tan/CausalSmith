/-! # `Causalean.ML.NeuralNet` — feedforward networks

Roll-up for dense affine layers, activations carrying Lipschitz constants, and
uniform-width feedforward network evaluation.  The imported API includes
coordinatewise activation, layer-list evaluation, composition under layer-list
append, and a Lipschitz bound obtained by multiplying the per-layer constants.
