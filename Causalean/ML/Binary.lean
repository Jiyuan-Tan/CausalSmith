/-! # `Causalean.ML.Binary` — logistic losses and rates

Roll-up of the logistic part of `Causalean.ML`: convexity and compact-set
existence for empirical logistic risk, pointwise Fisher consistency of the
Bernoulli cross-entropy loss, and the root-n L² estimation rate for an
L²-regularized logistic quasi-score M-estimator. The rate file allows a
real-valued response coordinate, so this namespace is about logistic prediction
and binary-loss geometry rather than only zero-one classification.
