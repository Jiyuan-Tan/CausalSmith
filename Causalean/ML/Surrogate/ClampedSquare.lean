/-! # Clamped square surrogate for squared-loss contraction bounds

The clamped square is a globally Lipschitz surrogate for the squared map on a
bounded prediction range.  The basic loss `squaredLoss` lives in
`ML/Core/Losses`; this separate surrogate file imports the Rademacher
contraction interface and proves the analytic facts needed for squared-loss
complexity bounds.  The clipping itself is `Causalean.Mathlib.Analysis.clipIcc`
(see `Mathlib/Analysis/ClipInterval`), whose contraction and boundedness lemmas
are reused here.

On the band `[-c, c]`, `clampedSq c t` agrees with `t²`; globally, it is
`2c`-Lipschitz and fixes zero.  This is the standard route for applying a
Ledoux-Talagrand contraction bound to bounded squared-loss classes.

* `clampedSq_eq_sq` — `clampedSq c t = t²` whenever `|t| ≤ c`;
* `lipschitzAt0_clampedSq` — `clampedSq c` is `LipschitzAt0` with constant `2c` for `c ≥ 0`.

/-- For [a real clipping bound](hyp:c) and [a real input](hyp:t), the [clamped-square
surrogate](goal) is the square of the input after applying the interval-clipping rule with
endpoints $-c$ and $c$. This definition applies to every pair of real numbers, including when
the two endpoints are not ordered.

The clamped square is a globally Lipschitz surrogate that agrees with the squared map on a
bounded prediction range. -/
