/-! # Abstract quarter-rate assembly for DML nuisance conditions

This file consumes abstract error sequences already assumed to have
`o_p(n^{-1/4})` rates and derives the three corresponding nuisance-rate conditions
used by DML. It does not connect those sequences to a concrete learner or invoke a
method-specific `AchievesL2Rate` theorem.

It is method-agnostic: once a learner proves an `o_p(n^{-1/4})` L²-rate toward a target
that a separate identification argument equates almost everywhere with the causal
nuisance, plug its error sequence in as `μErr` / `eErr`. Fixed-penalty ridge and logistic
rates target penalized pseudo-true predictors; they do not by themselves provide this
identification. Instantiating
`μErr a n ω := (eLpNorm (fun x => μ̂ n ω a x − μ_val a x) 2 P_X).toReal` (and `eErr`
analogously) makes the three outputs *literally* DML's `h_mu_rate` / `h_e_rate` /
`h_product_rate`.

and propensity error sequences](hyp:μErr,eErr), if, for every treatment arm, [the
outcome-regression estimation error is `o_p(n^{-1/4})`](hyp:hμ), and [the propensity
estimation error is `o_p(n^{-1/4})`](hyp:he), then [each error is separately `o_p(1)`, and
for every arm the
pointwise product of the outcome and propensity errors is `o_p(n^{-1/2})`](goal) —
together these are DML's three nuisance-rate conditions. -/
