/-! # ML learners as causal nuisance estimators

Using the conditional-expectation bridge (`RegressionBridge`), the population
targets of the `Causalean.ML` learners are exactly the causal nuisance functions
that the AIPW / DML machinery consumes: the squared-loss target on a treatment arm
is the outcome regression `μ(d, x) = E[Y ∣ X, D=d]`, and the squared-loss target
on the treatment indicator is the propensity `e(x) = P(D=1 ∣ X)`.
`mlNuisanceVec` packages two such targets into the `Estimation.ATE.NuisanceVec`
the AIPW moment expects.
