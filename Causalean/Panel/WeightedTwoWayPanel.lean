/-! # Weighted Finite Two-Way Panel Helpers

Paper-agnostic finite-sum infrastructure for two-way panels under a **general
unit weight** `p : Unit → ℝ` (a pmf: `∑ p = 1`, `0 < p i`) with a uniform period
measure. This is the share-weighted generalization of the uniform two-way panel
algebra used by the estimand-characterization modules:

* uniform balanced panels recover the old `UniformTwoWayPanel` by `p ≡ 1/|Unit|`;
* Goodman-Bacon cohort-share panels take `p = cohort shares`.

It provides the `p`-weighted unit/time/grand means, double demeaning (`ddot`), the
`p`-weighted inner product, the unit/time additive nuisance class, the
reconstruction identity, and the share-weighted orthogonality theorems
(`ddot` ⟂ unit / time / additive).

## Bridge to the generic `WeightedSupport` FWL tower

The closed forms above are connected to the abstract Frisch–Waugh–Lovell
substrate in `Causalean/Panel/Weighted/` by the `Bridge` section: the panel is the
cell support `R = Unit × Time` with weight `ω_{(i,t)} = p_i / |Time|`
(`cellSupport`), the `p`-weighted inner product is `|Time|` times
`WeightedSupport.ip` (`inner_eq_card_smul_ip`), and `ddot` is the generic residual
maker against the two-axis additive span (`ddot_eq_residualize`).  The abstract
FWL coefficient lemma `Weighted.WeightedSupport.scalar_fwl_of_normalEqs` is thus
reusable through the bridge.

/-! ### Bridge to the generic `WeightedSupport` FWL tower

The bespoke `p`-weighted inner product and double demeaning above are the
*concrete closed forms*; the generic Frisch–Waugh–Lovell substrate in
`Causalean/Panel/Weighted/` (`WeightedSupport.ip`, `residualize`,
`scalar_fwl_of_normalEqs`) is the *abstract orthogonal-projection* layer.  This
section connects the two: the panel is the cell support `R = Unit × Time` with
weight `ω_{(i,t)} = p_i / |Time|`, the `p`-weighted inner product is `|Time|`
times `WeightedSupport.ip`, and `ddot` is the generic residual maker against the
two-axis additive span.  Downstream code can therefore read the explicit
demeaning formula off the abstract projection and reuse `scalar_fwl_of_normalEqs`
on the panel. -/
