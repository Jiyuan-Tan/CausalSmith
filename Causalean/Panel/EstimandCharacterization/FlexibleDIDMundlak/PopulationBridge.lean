# Wooldridge finite imputation estimand to population conditional expectation

Bridges the finite-cell imputation residual mean `imputationTheta` to the
population conditional expectation
`normalizedRestrictedIntegral μ cohortEvent Δ`, via the law of iterated
expectations over the finite covariate partition
(`Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.eventCondExp_eq_sum_condProb_mul_eventCondExp`).

The bridge is *hypothesis-driven*: it takes a probability model `(μ, cohortEvent,
covarCell, Δ)` together with two identification hypotheses that connect the
finite-cell construction's primitive means to that model — the covariate weights are the
conditional cell probabilities, and each finite cell residual is the within-cell
conditional mean of the treatment-effect integrand `Δ`.  Those hypotheses are
exactly the paper's *definition* of `θ^imp` as `E[Δ | G = g]` together with the
finite cell-average representation; the bridge is the total-expectation identity
connecting them.  No paper assumption is strengthened.

/-! # Wooldridge Population Bridge

This file connects Wooldridge's finite imputation estimands to population
conditional expectations.  The main bridges are
`imputationTheta_eq_eventCondExp` and `thetaImp_eq_eventCondExp`, which apply the
finite-partition law of iterated expectations to identify covariate-weighted
finite residual means with event-level conditional expectations.  The companion
lemmas `m0_eq_eventCondExp_treated` and `m0_eq_eventCondExp_untreated` state the
population conditional-expectation origin of the saturated untreated fit on
treated and untreated cells. -/

/-- The [finite imputation residual mean equals the population conditional mean
of an integrable effect](goal) for [a cell system and untreated fit](hyp:P,S) at
[a selected cohort and period](hyp:g,t) over [finite cohort, period, and covariate
sets](hyp:Cohort,Time,Covar). This holds in [a finite-measure model](hyp:Ω,μ) for
[an integrable effect](hyp:Δ,hΔ) on [a measurable cohort event](hyp:cohortEvent,hG)
when [measurable, pairwise-disjoint covariate cells partition the sample
space](hyp:covarCell,hC,hdisj,hcov), [the supplied weights are the corresponding
conditional probabilities](hyp:hweight), and [the finite residuals are the
within-cell conditional means](hyp:hcell).

`imputationTheta P S g t = ∑_c covarWeight(g,c)·(observedMean − m0)` equals the
population conditional expectation `E[Δ | G = g]` of the treatment-effect
integrand `Δ` on the cohort event `cohortEvent`, under the identification
hypotheses:

* `hweight`: each covariate weight is the conditional cell probability
  `P(C = c | G = g) = μ(cohortEvent ∩ covarCell c) / μ(cohortEvent)`;
* `hcell`: each finite cell residual `observedMean − m0` is the within-cell
  conditional mean, represented by `normalizedRestrictedIntegral` on the
  intersection of the cohort event and that covariate cell.

This is a direct application of the conditional finite-partition total law
(law of iterated expectations) to the covariate partition `covarCell`. -/

[each finite cell residual — the observed mean minus the fitted untreated

/-! ### Population Origin of `m0`

The finite-cell projection origin of `m0` (`SaturatedUntreatedRegression.untreatedNormalEq`)
is already in `DID.lean`, and `recovers_target_Y0` / `untreatedFit` derive the
exact untreated-mean recovery from no-anticipation + conditional parallel trends.
The population bridge reads the finite untreated-outcome cell mean `Y0Mean` as
the population conditional expectation
`E[Y_t(∞) | G = g, t, C = c]` of the untreated potential outcome, so that the
saturated projection `m0` equals that conditional expectation cellwise.  The
identification hypothesis `hY0` is exactly the statement that the finite
primitive `Y0Mean` *is* that conditional mean — it is definitional, not a
strengthening; all causal content lives in `recovers_target_Y0` / `untreatedFit`. -/

/-- Under [no anticipation and additive conditional parallel trends](hyp:hNA,hCPT),
the [fitted untreated mean equals the population conditional mean of the untreated
outcome](goal) for [a cell system and saturated untreated regression](hyp:P,S) at
[a treated cell and covariate value](hyp:hgt,c) over [finite cohort, period, and
covariate sets](hyp:Cohort,Time,Covar). The population quantity is supplied by [a
measure model](hyp:Ω,μ), [cell events and an untreated outcome](hyp:cellEvent,Y0pop),
and [the identification of the primitive cell mean with that conditional
mean](hyp:hY0).

The saturated untreated regression's fitted value equals the population
conditional expectation of the untreated potential outcome
`E[Y_t(∞) | G = g, t, C = c]`,
given the identification of the primitive cell mean with
`normalizedRestrictedIntegral μ (cellEvent g t c) Y0pop`.
The causal content (additive extrapolation from untreated to treated cells via
conditional parallel trends) is carried by `recovers_target_Y0`. -/

On an untreated cell, the fitted value likewise equals
`E[Y_t(∞) | G = g, t, C = c]`: `untreatedFit`
gives `m0 = YgMean`, no-anticipation turns that into `Y0Mean`, and `hY0` reads
`Y0Mean` as the population conditional mean. -/
