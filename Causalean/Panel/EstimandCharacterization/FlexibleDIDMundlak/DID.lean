/-! # Wooldridge Flexible DID Cells

This file provides finite-cell primitives for Wooldridge-style flexible
imputation, pooled least squares, and extended two-way fixed effects
difference-in-differences estimands. It defines staggered-adoption cell means,
support conditions, untreated-outcome regressions, normal-equation-based
POLS/ETWFE coefficients, and aggregate ATT quantities. The main public theorem
is `flexible_did_scaffold_characterization`, the finite-cell characterization, with cell and
aggregate components
available as `flexible_did_cell_characterization` and
`flexible_did_aggregate_characterization`. -/

Conditional expectations are encoded as primitive finite-cell means; `treatedCell g t` is
the target cohort-time set `q ≤ g ≤ t ≤ T`, and `untreatedCell g t` marks observations
used to fit the untreated-outcome regression. -/

every treated cell. Equivalently, there is no nonzero additive function

/-- A finite-cell weighted least-squares fit of the untreated-outcome mean for a staggered cell
design `P`, restricted to the untreated observations. It bundles [a fitted untreated-outcome
mean](hyp:m0) that [is additive in cohort and time given the covariate cell](hyp:additive),
[projection weights that are strictly positive on the untreated
design](hyp:untreatedWeight,untreatedWeight_pos), the requirement that [the fit solves the
covariate/cell-weighted normal equations against every additive test function, summed over the
untreated design](hyp:untreatedNormalEq), [full-rank identification of the additive class from
vanishing on the untreated design alone](hyp:design_identifies), and [a positive cohort share on
every treated cell](hyp:target_cell_support).

The fitted untreated mean `m0(g,t,c)` is additive in cohort/time conditional on
covariates. The field `untreatedNormalEq` states the weighted least-squares
normal equations for projecting the observed outcome onto this additive class
using untreated observations only: against every additive test function, the
covariate/cell-weighted residual `observedMean - m0` sums to zero on the
untreated design.

The exact-fit facts are proved below rather than stored as fields:
`untreatedFit` derives agreement on untreated cells from the normal equations,
no anticipation, and conditional parallel trends, while `recovers_target_Y0`
uses `UntreatedDesignIdentifies` to extend the untreated-outcome fit to target
treated cells. The companion population bridge relates these finite-cell means
to conditional expectations. -/

/-- The weighted projection `m0` reproduces the factual cohort-`g` outcome mean

Proof: under no anticipation the untreated observed mean equals the cohort-`g`
mean, and under conditional parallel trends it is additive (lies in `H0`).  The
residual `m0 − Y0Mean` is then itself additive (`additive` + `hCPT`); plugging it
into the weighted untreated normal equations (`untreatedNormalEq`) shows the
positively-weighted sum of its squares over the untreated design vanishes, so the
residual is zero on every untreated cell — the projection is exact there. -/

/-- On top of a staggered-cell design `P` and its saturated untreated-outcome regression `S`,
this structure packages three families of treated-cell coefficients — [an imputation
coefficient](hyp:thetaImp), [a pooled-least-squares (POLS) coefficient](hyp:thetaPOLS), and [an
extended two-way-fixed-effects (ETWFE) coefficient](hyp:thetaETWFE) — together with the
conditions pinning them down: [on every treated cell the imputation coefficient equals the
covariate-weighted imputation residual mean](hyp:thetaImp_eq_imputation), and [the POLS and
ETWFE coefficients each solve the finite-cell covariate-weighted residual normal
equation](hyp:pols_cell_normalEq,etwfe_cell_normalEq).

`pols_cell_normalEq` and `etwfe_cell_normalEq` carry the per-cell FWL output of
the saturated regression: the covariate-weighted residual normal equation for
each treated cell. By `cellIndicator_normalEq_eq_cellResidual`, this per-cell
equation is equivalent to the full saturated normal equation for that cell's
treated indicator. The ETWFE leg additionally uses the FWL/TWFE-Mundlak
residualization from `TWFE.lean` to identify its residualized treated regressor
with the POLS one; that identification is recorded by sharing the same
`cellResidualNormalEq` form. -/

[conditional parallel trends holds — the mean untreated potential outcome

the POLS/ETWFE finite-cell residual normal equations carried by `E`, [on every
