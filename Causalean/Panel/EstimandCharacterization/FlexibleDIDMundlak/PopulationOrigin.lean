# Wooldridge population origin of staggered-DID cell means

Makes the conditional-expectation origin of the staggered-DID cell means
definitional rather than an assumed identification hypothesis.

`StaggeredATTCells.ofPopulation` builds a `StaggeredATTCells` out of a probability
model `(μ, cellEvent, Y0pop, Ygpop, Yobspop)` by *defining* each cell mean as the
event-level conditional expectation `eventCondExp μ (cellEvent g t c) ·` of the
corresponding population outcome. The constructor assumes positive cell mass and
cell-level integrability for the untreated, cohort-specific, and observed
outcomes, so the resulting means have the intended population interpretation.
With this definition:

* `consistency_treated` / `consistency_untreated` are **derived** from pointwise
  potential-outcome consistency on each cell (`eventCondExp_congr_on`), exactly as
  DCDH's `cellMean_consistency` derives the DCDH consistency identity;
* the identification hypothesis `hY0` of `PopulationBridge.m0_eq_eventCondExp_*`
  holds by `rfl`, since `Y0Mean` is now *defined* as that `eventCondExp`.

The payoff corollaries `m0_eq_eventCondExp_treated_ofPopulation` /
`_untreated_ofPopulation` show that on the relevant cell the saturated
untreated regression's fitted value equals the population conditional expectation
`E[Y_t(∞) | G = g, t, C = c]`, with the *causal* content carried entirely by
`recovers_target_Y0` / `untreatedFit`.  No paper assumption is strengthened: the
covariate-weight witness (`cohortShare`, `covarWeight`) is passed in exactly as
DCDH passes the FWL residual `Dtilde`, and the pointwise consistency inputs are
exactly the paper's consistency axiom restricted to each cell.

/-! # Wooldridge Population Origin

This file constructs the finite staggered-DID cell system from an underlying
probability model.  `StaggeredATTCells.ofPopulation` defines the cell means as
raw event-level quotients of population outcomes and derives the consistency
fields from pointwise potential-outcome consistency on the corresponding cells.
The corollaries `m0_eq_eventCondExp_treated_ofPopulation` and
`m0_eq_eventCondExp_untreated_ofPopulation` specialize the population bridge for
systems built by this constructor, so the untreated-fit identification
hypothesis is definitional. -/

Builds a finite staggered-DID cell system from a population model.

The probability model has a sample space `Ω` with cell
events `cellEvent g t c` and population potential / factual outcomes
`Y0pop`, `Ygpop`, `Yobspop`.  The cell means are *defined* as the population
event-level conditional expectations

* `Y0Mean g t c     = E[Y(0)  | cell g t c]`,
* `YgMean g t c      = E[Y(g)  | cell g t c]`,
* `observedMean g t c = E[Y_obs | cell g t c]`.

The two consistency fields are **derived** from pointwise potential-outcome
consistency on each cell (`hcons_tr` / `hcons_ut`) via `eventCondExp_congr_on`:
on a treated cell the observed factual equals the cohort-`g` outcome pointwise,
on an untreated cell it equals the untreated outcome pointwise.

As in `DCDHPanel.ofPopulation`, the cell-weight data (`cohortShare`,
`covarWeight`) and their side conditions (`cohortShare_pos_on_treated`,
`covarWeight_nonneg`, `covarWeight_sum_one`) are supplied as witnesses — the
weight construction is separate from the population cell-mean definitions. -/

/-- **On a treated cell in a population-built system, the fitted untreated mean
equals the population conditional mean of the untreated potential outcome.**
Fix a population model on a sample space `Ω`, with population outcomes
`Y0pop`, `Ygpop`, `Yobspop`; suppose [every cell event `cellEvent g t c` is
measurable](hyp:hmeas), [every cell has strictly positive probability
mass](hyp:hcell_pos), and [the three population outcomes are each integrable on
every cell](hyp:hY0_int,hYg_int,hYobs_int). Suppose also [the cohort share is
strictly positive on every treated cell](hyp:cohortShare_pos_on_treated), [the
covariate weights are nonnegative](hyp:covarWeight_nonneg) and [sum to one
within each cohort](hyp:covarWeight_sum_one), and [the observed outcome agrees
pointwise with the cohort-`g` outcome on treated cells and with the untreated
outcome on untreated cells (pointwise consistency)](hyp:hcons_tr,hcons_ut). If
[the finite cell system `P` is exactly the one built from this population data
by `StaggeredATTCells.ofPopulation`](hyp:hP) and, for a saturated untreated
regression `S` on `P`, [no anticipation holds](hyp:hNA) and [conditional
parallel trends holds](hyp:hCPT), then on [any treated cell `(g,t)`](hyp:hgt),
[the saturated regression's fitted value `S.m0 g t c` equals the population
conditional mean `E[Y0pop | cellEvent g t c]`, for every covariate cell
`c`](goal).

Because `P.Y0Mean g t c` is defined as
`eventCondExp μ (cellEvent g t c) Y0pop`, the population-identification
hypothesis used by `m0_eq_eventCondExp_treated` holds by `rfl`. The causal
content (additive extrapolation via conditional parallel trends) is carried by
`recovers_target_Y0`. -/
