# Sun-Abraham (2021): population bridge to the finite event-study system

Anchors the abstract `EventStudySystem` (whose mean fields are free reals) to a
genuine probability space carrying adoption-path–indexed potential outcomes.
An `EventStudyPopulation` bundles `(Ω, μ)`, a realized adoption cohort
`G : Ω → WithTop (Fin T)`, a calendar-time map, and the potential-outcome family
`Ypath t h ω = Y_{ωt}(h)`. Its `toSystem` fills every mean field of
`EventStudySystem` with an event-level conditional mean of a potential-outcome
slice (via `eventCondExp`); in particular the estimand
`CATT g e` becomes the genuine population contrast
`E[Y_{·t}(g) − Y_{·t}(∞) ∣ G = g]`.

The three Sun-Abraham causal restrictions
(`Consistency`, `NoAnticipation`, `PathConsistency`) are then **derived** from
Ω-level potential-outcome facts (the observed outcome is the PO under the
realized path — consistency is definitional — and structural no-anticipation),
not assumed on the abstract reals. Only `MeanParallelUntreated` — the additive
fixed-effect parallel-trends restriction on the never-treated potential outcome —
remains a genuine modeling hypothesis, supplied to the discharge lemma.

This file constructs a finite `EventStudySystem` from a probability space with
adoption-path potential outcomes, defining its mean fields as cohort-cell
conditional means and deriving the Sun-Abraham causal restrictions from the
underlying potential-outcome structure. -/

/-- A staggered-adoption event-study **population**: [a probability space](hyp:Ω,measΩ,μ,probμ)
carrying [a realized adoption cohort `G`](hyp:G) — with [every cohort cell
measurable](hyp:Gcell_meas) — [a calendar-time map `time`](hyp:time) that is [strictly
increasing in the period index](hyp:time_strictMono), [a finite set `cohorts` of adoption
cohorts in the event-study support](hyp:cohorts), and [adoption-path–indexed potential outcomes
`Ypath t h ω = Y_{ωt}(h)`](hyp:Ypath) satisfying [structural no-anticipation: in any period
where a path is untreated, its outcome equals the never-treated outcome, for every
unit](hyp:hNoAnt).

The cohort cells `{ω | G ω = h}` (over all paths `h : WithTop (Fin T)`,
including `⊤` = never-treated) are measurable events on which the event-study
means are computed. They are not required to have positive mass globally:
zero-mass paths are allowed, and support/positivity is imposed only by the
downstream event-level design hypotheses that need it. `time` is required
strictly monotone so that the calendar order used by `NoAnticipation` agrees
with the adoption-date order used by `absorbingTreatment`. -/

`cellMass g t` is period-independent, equal to the cross-sectional cohort mass
`ℙ(G = g)`: in the balanced unit-period population the abstract system targets,
cohort `g`'s cell at every period `t` is the cohort-`g` units, of mass `ℙ(G = g)`.
This is faithful because `cellMass` enters the downstream objects only through the
normalized contamination weight `omega = cellMassAtEvent · Rdot / residualDenom`
and the cell-grid weight `cellMassAtEvent / cellTotalMass`, both of which are
ratios in which any uniform rescaling of `cellMass` cancels; the absolute value
never matters. (It would be wrong for an *unbalanced* panel, which is out of the
system's balanced scope.) -/

condition under which each cohort-cell mean
