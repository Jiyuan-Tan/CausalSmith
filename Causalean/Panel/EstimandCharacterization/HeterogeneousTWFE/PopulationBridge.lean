# DCDH cell consistency from a potential-outcome contrast

Supplies the population origin of the `DCDHPanel.consistency` field at the level
of cell-conditional means, connecting the finite treatment-effect field to an
actual potential-outcome contrast.

On a group-time cell event `A` where treatment is constant `D ≡ d ∈ {0,1}` and
potential-outcome consistency `Y = Y0 + D·(Y1 − Y0)` holds pointwise, the raw
cell event quotients satisfy the DCDH consistency identity
`Ȳ = Ȳ(0) + d·(Ȳ(1) − Ȳ(0))`, where the treatment-effect field is defined as the
difference between the `Y1` and `Y0` cell quotients.

This is *hypothesis-driven*: it takes the probability model `(μ, A, Y, Y0, Y1)`
and the pointwise consistency hypothesis (PO consistency restricted to the cell),
and discharges the consistency identity for the population cell means.  No paper
assumption is strengthened — `hcons` is exactly the paper's consistency axiom
`Y = Y(0) + D·(Y(1) − Y(0))`, while this constructor leaves any integrability
interpretation of those quotients to separate hypotheses or corollaries.

/-! # DCDH Population Bridge

This file connects the finite DCDH panel fields to a probability model with cell
events and potential outcomes.  The constructor `DCDHPanel.ofPopulation` builds a
finite panel whose cell weights are cell probabilities, whose `Y` and `Y0` fields
are population cell means, and whose `tau` field is the difference between the
`Y1` and `Y0` cell means.  Its `consistency` and `pi_sum_one` fields are derived
from the shared cell-partition mean-consistency and finite-partition mass
identities. -/

Builds a finite DCDH panel from a population model.

The construction starts from a probability model with a finite partition into
group-time cells, factual and potential outcomes, and a binary cell-level
treatment.  The panel's outcomes are the population cell-conditional means:
`Y` is the factual cell mean, `Y0` is the untreated-potential cell mean, and
`tau` is the difference between the treated- and untreated-potential cell means.
The cell weights are the cell probabilities `pi g t = μ(cell g t)`.  The
`consistency` field is *derived* from pointwise potential-outcome consistency on
each cell via the shared `CellPartition.mean_consistency`, and `pi_sum_one` from
the shared `CellPartition.mass_sum_one` finite-partition additivity. The cell
statistics `pi`, `Y`, `Y0`, `tau` are the shared `CellPartition.mass` / `.mean`
over the cohort-period partition.

As in the base `DCDHPanel`, the residualized treatment `Dtilde` (and its
orthogonality / nonzero-variation properties) is supplied as a witness: deriving
the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell residual for *general* cell weights is a separate
construction (the uniform-weight case is `DCDHPanel.ofTwoWayPanel` in
`FWLBridge.lean`).  This constructor exhibits `tau` as the potential-outcome
contrast `Y(1) − Y(0)` inside an actual `DCDHPanel`. -/
