# Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess efficiency: OLS imputation is BLUE under spherical errors

The efficiency half of `prop:po-estimand-bjs-linear-unbiased-imputation`.  The BJS
imputation estimator is the OLS estimator for the event-study design `designFull`
(a treated-cell indicator block stacked with the covariate block).  Applying the
finite Gauss-Markov theorem `variance_blue_spherical` to this design shows the OLS
estimator has minimum variance among all linear unbiased estimators of the target.

/-! # Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess Efficiency

This file connects the finite BJS imputation design to Gauss-Markov efficiency.
It builds the full event-study design matrix and proves that the OLS imputation
weights attain no larger variance than any linear unbiased estimator under
spherical cell-outcome errors. -/

/-- For [a BJS event-study panel with finite treated cells, untreated cells, and regressors](hyp:P), the [full event-study design matrix](goal) has one row for each treated or untreated observed cell and one column for each treated-cell effect or regressor. A treated-cell row has its own effect indicator and its treated-cell regressor row, whereas an untreated-cell row has zero effect indicators and its untreated-cell regressor row.

Rows are observed cells, and columns stack treated-cell effects with covariates. -/

/-! ### Fixed-effect block ↔ panel `IndicatorSpan`

The treated-cell fixed-effect block of `designFull` (the τ-columns) is exactly the
panel indicator-span substrate `Causalean.Panel.Weighted.IndicatorSpan`: each
τ-column is the cell indicator of the treated-cell classifier on observed cells.
This connects the event-study design to the panel FE/indicator-span layer; it is
additive — the BLUE result above stays on the finite Gauss-Markov substrate
(§13gm), the correct home for the variance argument. -/
