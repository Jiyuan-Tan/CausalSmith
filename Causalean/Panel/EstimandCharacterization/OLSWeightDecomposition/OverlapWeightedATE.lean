# Finite-cell overlap-weighted ATE

This file states the finite-cell headline theorem: the saturated-OLS
residualized coefficient equals the overlap-weighted ATE built from real
potential outcomes. The supporting measure-theoretic machinery lives in the
`Support/` subfolder:

* `Support.Basic` — saturated class, cell statistics, and elementary bounds.
* `Support.Integrals` — reusable cell integral identities.
* `Support.Orthogonality` — per-cell orthogonality and observed-outcome L².
* `Support.Partition` — finite partition and residualization witnesses.
* `Support.PerCell` — denominator and numerator per-cell bridge identities.

/-! # Finite-Cell Overlap-Weighted ATE

This file holds the finite-cell **headline theorem** of the module: starting
from a probability space with a binary treatment, potential outcomes, and a
finite covariate `G`, the saturated-OLS residualized coefficient is identified
with the overlap-weighted average treatment effect
`Σ ω_g · E[Y(1)−Y(0) ∣ G=g]`. This is where the abstract `FinitePartition`
algebra acquires its causal content; the `Support/` files provide the
per-cell measure-theoretic machinery. The continuous-covariate counterpart is
`GeneralCondExp.lean`. This theorem is an overlap-weighted conditional-effect
identity; it does not derive an ATT/ATU representation. -/

/-- **Finite-cell saturated-OLS bridge to the overlap-weighted average
treatment effect.** For a probability space `(Ω, μ)` with a measurable binary
treatment `D`, an outcome `Y`, square-integrable potential outcomes `Y0`,
`Y1`, and a measurable finite covariate `G`, suppose [treatment is binary
almost everywhere](hyp:B_binary), [the observed outcome is consistent — `Y`
equals `D·Y1 + (1−D)·Y0` almost everywhere](hyp:B_consis), [the
integrated-indicator finite-cell bridge condition holds, a finite-cell
operational substitute for full conditional-mean independence of the
potential outcomes given treatment and the covariate](hyp:B_CMI), and [the
covariate cells have nondegenerate treatment overlap](hyp:B_overlap). Then
[the saturated-OLS residualized coefficient of `Y` on `D` given `G` equals the
overlap-weighted average treatment effect `Σ_g ω_g · E[Y(1)−Y(0) ∣ G=g]` built
from the potential outcomes `Y0`, `Y1`](goal):

    residualizedCoefficient μ (saturatedClass μ G B_meas_G)
        (residWitnessY μ Y G B_meas_G ...)
        (residWitnessD μ D G B_meas_G B_meas_D B_binary)
      = overlapWeightedATE
            (partitionOf μ D Y0 Y1 G B_meas_G B_binary B_overlap).

`Y_memLp` is derived internally from `B_consis`, `B_binary`, `B_Y0_L2`, and
`B_Y1_L2` via `Y_memLp_of_consistency`. The denominator positivity
`0 < ∫ D̃² dμ` is derived from `B_overlap` via the per-cell denominator sum
`hDen_sum`, so no separate residual-variation hypothesis is needed.

Here `B_CMI` is the integrated-indicator finite-cell bridge condition implied
by the usual conditional-mean independence clause `E[Y(d) | D, G] = E[Y(d) | G]`
(this is a strictly weaker operational substitute on a finite-cell partition,
sufficient for the proof but not equivalent to full CMI).

This finite-cell statement is the finite-partition corollary formalized without
importing `Mathlib.MeasureTheory.Function.ConditionalExpectation.*`.

Proof sketch: per-cell denominator (`denom_per_cell`) and numerator
(`num_per_cell`) identities sum to the FWL ratio; replacing `Y` with
`wY.Vtilde` is harmless via `wD.orthogonal` against
`wY.VH = meanReg μ Y G`. The finite-partition algebra object on the right side has
`π_g = cellMass g`, `p_g = cellShare g`, `τ_g = cellTau g` by
construction in `partitionOf`, so the ratio equality is immediate. -/
