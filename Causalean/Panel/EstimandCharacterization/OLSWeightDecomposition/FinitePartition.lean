# Słoczyński (2022): finite-partition OLS weights with heterogeneous effects

Pure finite-cell algebra for the Słoczyński saturated-OLS weight formulas.
Formalizes:

* `prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-finite-weights` — the saturated OLS
  estimand decomposes as `Σ ω_g τ_g`, `ω_g ∝ π_g p_g (1−p_g)`.
* `prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-equal-groups` (finite half) — if every
  `p_g = 1/2`, the overlap weights collapse to the cell probabilities.
* `prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-homogeneous` (saturated half) — if
  `τ` is constant, the OLS estimand is that constant.

The opposite-group ATT/ATU representation
(`ass:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-opposite-group`,
`prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-opposite-group`,
`prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-equal-groups` ATT/ATU half,
`prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-homogeneous` ATT/ATU half) is recorded
as a separate algebraic structure `OppositeGroupRepr`.

This file is pure finite-cell algebra. The symbols `π`, `p`, and `τ` stand for
cell probabilities, treated shares, and cell-level effects in the finite
partition. Their probability-space interpretation — including
`τ_g = E[Y(1)−Y(0) ∣ G=g]` built from potential outcomes under the finite-cell
bridge condition — is supplied by `bridge_finite_residualized_eq_overlap` in
`OverlapWeightedATE.lean`, where `partitionOf` instantiates this structure from
a probability space. See
`prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-finite-weights` and
`Causalean/Panel/EstimandCharacterization/OLSWeightDecomposition/OverlapWeightedATE.lean`.

This file formalizes the finite-cell algebra behind Słoczyński's saturated
ordinary least squares weights with heterogeneous treatment effects. It defines
`FinitePartition`, `cellOverlap`, `overlapWeight`, and
`overlapWeightedATE`, proves the normalized-weight identity
`finite_weights_eq_sum`, and records the equal-share and homogeneous-effect
collapses. It also defines `perTreatedWeight` and `perUntreatedWeight` for the
per-observation leverage interpretation, and `OppositeGroupRepr` for the
separate ATT/ATU opposite-group representation with the derived theorem
`represents`. -/

The paper (Słoczyński 2022, Remark `rem:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-group-size`)
notes that in the overlap-weighted OLS formula each treated observation in
cell `g` contributes a leverage factor of `1 − p_g` (the untreated share),
while each untreated observation contributes `p_g` (the treated share).
This definition makes the first factor explicit; see
`perTreatedWeight_antitone`, `perUntreatedWeight_monotone`, and
`cellOverlap_eq_perWeights_mul` for the main monotonicity claims. -/

/-- For [a finite covariate partition](hyp:P) and [one of its cells](hyp:g), the [per-untreated-observation leverage factor](goal) is $p_g$, the treated share in that cell.

Each untreated observation in cell `g` contributes a leverage factor of
`p_g` (the treated share). Cells with more treated units (high `p_g`) give
each untreated unit a larger per-observation weight; cells with fewer
treated units (low `p_g`) give each untreated unit a smaller weight.

weight interpretation. -/

/-- **Headline monotonicity — smaller treated group gets larger per-treated
weight** (`rem:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-group-size`). The per-treated-observation
leverage factor `1 − p_g` is antitone in the treated share: if [cell `g` has a
treated share no larger than cell `h`'s](hyp:hph), then [`g`'s per-treated-observation
leverage factor is at least `h`'s:
`perTreatedWeight P h ≤ perTreatedWeight P g`](goal).

In words: the *minority* treatment-status group in a cell receives the
larger per-observation weight. A cell where almost everyone is treated
(`p_g ≈ 1`) downweights each treated observation to near 0; a cell where
almost no one is treated (`p_g ≈ 0`) upweights each treated observation
toward 1.

This formalizes the paper's title insight ("Smaller Groups Get Larger
Weights") for the treated side. -/

/-- **Monotonicity — larger treated group gives larger per-untreated weight**
(`rem:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-group-size`, untreated side). The
per-untreated-observation leverage factor `p_g` is monotone in the treated
share: if [cell `g` has a treated share no larger than cell `h`'s](hyp:hph),
then [`h`'s per-untreated-observation leverage factor is at least `g`'s:
`perUntreatedWeight P g ≤ perUntreatedWeight P h`](goal).

Symmetrically to `perTreatedWeight_antitone`: the minority
untreated group in a cell receives the larger per-observation weight. -/

/-- Słoczyński's two-component ATT/ATU representation
(`ass:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-opposite-group`).

The conventional (single-dummy) OLS treatment coefficient is *assumed* to
admit Słoczyński's two-component causal representation
`β_ols = w₁·τ_ATT + w₀·τ_ATU` with `w₁ + w₀ = 1` (field `twoComponent`,
`weights_sum_one`). This is the paper's genuine structural assumption: per
`rem:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-no-covariate-caveat` it is recorded
*separately* and must NOT be derived from the saturated-overlap formula
(`β_sat = Σ ω_g τ_g`), which is a different, non-saturated estimand — they
disagree numerically in general. The **equal-dispersion** case then imposes
the opposite-group weight `w₁ = 1 − ρ` (field `equalDispersion`); `w₀ = ρ`
follows from `weights_sum_one` (lemma `w0_eq_rho`).

The opposite-group identity `β_ols = (1−ρ)·τ_ATT + ρ·τ_ATU`
is not a structure field: it is the *derived* theorem `represents`,
matching Proposition `prop:po-estimand-sloczynski-ols-opposite-group`, whose
proof is exactly the substitution `w₁ = 1−ρ`, `w₀ = ρ` into the two-component
representation. The general weight formula in terms of conditional
treatment-variance dispersion is not specified by the source and so is not
formalized; the equal-dispersion weights are the substantive content the
paper highlights. -/
