/-! # Słoczyński partition bridge

This file constructs the finite partition and residualization witnesses used to
connect saturated-control population objects with Słoczyński's finite-partition
OLS weight algebra. The definition `partitionOf` packages measurable binary
treatment and a finite cell classifier into the `FinitePartition` consumed by
the algebraic theorems, while `partitionOf_p_eq_eventCondExp` and
`partitionOf_tau_eq_eventCondExp` certify that its treated shares and
treatment effects are shared population cell means. The definitions
`residWitnessD` and `residWitnessY` build the residualization witnesses for the
treatment and observed outcome variables against the saturated control class. -/

/-- Given [a probability measure](hyp:μ), [a treatment variable](hyp:D), [the untreated and treated potential-outcome variables](hyp:Y0,Y1), and [a measurable finite cell classifier](hyp:G,G_meas), with [treatment equal to zero or one almost surely](hyp:D_binary) and [a strictly positive sum of cell masses times treated-share variances](hyp:overlap), [the finite Słoczyński partition](goal) consists of the cell masses, treated shares, and within-cell treatment effects.

The resulting partition uses the classifier's cell masses, within-cell treated
shares, and within-cell averages of the treated-minus-control potential-outcome
contrast. -/

/-- **Population-cell certificate for `partitionOf`.** For a probability space
`(Ω, μ)` with a measurable finite covariate `G` and treatment/potential-outcome
data `D`, `Y0`, `Y1`, suppose [treatment is binary almost
everywhere](hyp:D_binary) and [the covariate cells have nondegenerate
treatment overlap](hyp:overlap). Then, for any cell `g`, [the treated share
`p_g` of the Słoczyński partition `partitionOf` equals the shared population
cell mean `E[D ∣ G = g]`](goal) (via `eventCondExp`). -/

/-- Given [a probability measure](hyp:μ), [a treatment variable](hyp:D), and [a measurable finite cell classifier](hyp:G,G_meas), where [the treatment is measurable](hyp:D_meas) and [equals zero or one almost surely](hyp:D_binary), [the residualization witness for the treatment variable](goal) decomposes treatment into its saturated-cell propensity and an orthogonal residual.

With `VH := propensity μ D G` and
`Vtilde ω := D ω − propensity μ D G ω`, this packages the four
witness obligations:

* `VH_mem` — `propensity μ D G ∈ saturatedClass μ G` (by
  `propensity_mem_saturatedClass`).
* `Vtilde_memLp` — `D − propensity` is in `MemLp 2 μ` (boundedness +
  finite measure).
* `decomp` — `D = propensity + (D − propensity)` pointwise.
* `orthogonal` — `∫ (D − propensity) · h dμ = 0` for every
  `h ∈ saturatedClass μ G`. Reduces per cell to the defining identity
  of `cellShare`. -/
