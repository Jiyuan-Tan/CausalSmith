/-! # Słoczyński bridge basics

This file sets up the saturated finite-cell control class and the basic cell
statistics for Słoczyński's probability-space bridge. It defines
`saturatedClass`, `cellMass`, `cellShare`, `cellTau`, `propensity`, and
`meanReg`; relates `cellShare` and `cellTau` to the shared
`eventCondExp` population-cell operator; and proves the elementary bounds
`cellMass_nonneg`, `cellMass_sum_eq_one`, `cellShare_nonneg`, and
`cellShare_le_one`. The membership lemmas `propensity_mem_saturatedClass` and
`meanReg_mem_saturatedClass` supply the saturated-control pieces used by the
residualization witnesses. -/

/-- For [a finite measure on a sample space](hyp:μ), [a finite covariate-valued map](hyp:G), and [the measurability of that map](hyp:G_meas), the [saturated linear square-integrable control class](goal) consists of functions that agree almost everywhere with a linear combination of the indicators of the covariate cells.

Membership predicate (predicate-style, residualization_core D1 option (b)):

    f ∈ saturatedClass μ G  ↔  ∃ c : 𝒢 → ℝ,
        f =ᵐ[μ] (fun ω => ∑ g, c g · 𝟙{G ω = g}).

Closed under addition (sum the coefficient maps), scalar multiplication
(scale the coefficient map), and contains zero (take `c = 0`). Every member
is square-integrable on the finite measure `μ` because each indicator is
bounded. -/

/-! ### Bridge to the shared population cell-mean operator

The Słoczyński bridge computes cell means with `CellBridge.cellMean` (an
indicator-weighted integral over `{G = g}` divided by the cell mass). These
lemmas identify that operator with the shared `Causalean.PO.eventCondExp`
underlying `Panel.PO.CellPartition.mean`, so the OLS cell statistics
`cellShare` / `cellTau` are the same population cell means used by the other
panel population bridges. A full `CellPartition` cannot be formed here because
the Słoczyński estimand tolerates zero-mass cells, whereas `CellPartition`
requires strictly positive cells; the identity is therefore stated at the
operator level, which needs no positivity. -/

/-- For [an ambient probability space and covariate space](hyp:Ω,𝒢), [a probability measure
`μ` on `Ω`](hyp:μ), [an integrand `F`](hyp:F), [a measurable covariate map `G`](hyp:G,G_meas),
and [a covariate cell `g`](hyp:g), [the `CellBridge` indicator-weighted cell mean of `F` on
`{G = g}` equals the shared event-level conditional expectation of `F` given `{G = g}`](goal). -/
