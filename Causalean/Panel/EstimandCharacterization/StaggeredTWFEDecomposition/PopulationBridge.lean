# Goodman-Bacon (2021): TWFE decomposition under staggered timing — Layer B bridge

**Role in the folder.** *Population bridge.* Connects the finite `FinitePanel`
algebra to a real probability space — this is **statistical (population), not
causal**, meaning. The heavy cell algebra lives in the `Support/` subfolder;
this file states the public bridge theorems. See `StaggeredTWFEDecomposition.lean`
for the folder layer-map.

Layer B — measure-theoretic bridge from a probability space carrying the
balanced cohort-period law to the Layer A finite-cell `betaTWFE`. Mirrors
the Słoczyński Layer B file
`Panel/EstimandCharacterization/OLSWeightDecomposition/OverlapWeightedATE.lean`
in its split structure:

* `Support.Basic` — saturated cohort + period class, cell statistics,
  in-class projections, basic positivity bounds.
* `Support.Integrals` — reusable cell integral identities (per-axis and
  per-cell mass identities, plus per-axis-to-whole-class orthogonality
  decoupler).
* `Support.Orthogonality` — per-axis orthogonality of the residuals
  against cohort and period indicators. Requires the balanced-cell
  hypothesis `IsBalancedPanelLaw`.
* `Support.Partition` — `panelOf` finite-cell panel and the residualization
  witnesses `residWitnessD_panel` / `residWitnessY_panel`.
* `Support.PerCell` — denominator and numerator per-cell bridge identities.

This file preserves the public import path and states the headline bridge
theorems.

/-! # Goodman-Bacon Measure-Theoretic Bridge

This file states a conditional transport bridge from a probability-space panel
model to the finite Goodman-Bacon cohort-period algebra. It assumes explicit
compatibility between the population and finite residualized treatments; it
does not derive that compatibility from an observed staggered-adoption path.
Under that premise and the balanced cohort-period law, it identifies the
population residualized coefficient with the finite-cell TWFE coefficient. -/

/-- Positivity of the finite-panel treatment denominator
[is equivalent to positivity of the population residualized-treatment second moment](goal) for

[cohort and period labels](hyp:G,T_rv), and [an adoption schedule](hyp:A), provided

[treatment is constant at its mean within every cell](hyp:hD_cell), and
[population and finite residualized treatments agree in every cell](hyp:hDtilde_eq).

Callers who already hold `hVD_pos : 0 < VD P` (from the Layer A side) can
derive `hDtilde_pos` automatically:
```
  (bridge_VD_pos_iff_Dtilde_sq_pos_of_residual_compatibility …).mpr hVD_pos
```
eliminating the need to supply `hDtilde_pos` as an independent hypothesis to
`bridge_finite_residualized_eq_twfe_of_residual_compatibility`. Previously callers had to
supply both
`hVD_pos` and `hDtilde_pos` with no bridge between them. The equivalence is an
immediate rewrite via `bridge_Dtilde_sq_eq_VD_of_residual_compatibility`. -/

/-- The population coefficient from residualizing treatment and outcome on cohort and period
effects [equals the induced finite-panel TWFE coefficient](goal) for

[cohort and period labels](hyp:G,T_rv), and [an adoption schedule](hyp:A), provided
[the labels and treatment are measurable](hyp:G_meas,T_meas,D_meas),
[treatment is binary almost everywhere](hyp:D_binary),

**Note on `hDtilde_eq`.**
The hypothesis
```
hDtilde_eq : ∀ g t, panelDtilde μ D G T_rv g t =
                      Dtilde (panelOf …) g t
```
is an explicit residual-compatibility assumption. It is stronger than cell
measurability and is not derived here from the supplied adoption schedule `A`.
For a genuine staggered-adoption bridge one would instead start from a premise
```
hD_path : ∀ᵐ ω ∂μ, D ω = if AdoptionPath.le (A (G ω)) (T_rv ω) then 1 else 0
```
and derive residual compatibility by computing the cell means. Until that
derivation is formalized, this theorem is only a conditional transport result. -/
