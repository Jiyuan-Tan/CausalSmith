# Goodman-Bacon (2021): TWFE decomposition under staggered timing — Layer C

**Role in the folder.** *Causal layer (support for the causal headline).*
Provides the potential-outcome corollaries consumed by the fused headline
`CausalDecomposition.lean`. See `StaggeredTWFEDecomposition.lean` for the folder
layer-map.

Layer C — causal characterization of the three 2x2 contrasts. Promotes the
algebraic objects `Δ_TN, Δ_EL, Δ_LE` from Layer A to causal statements about
window-specific ATTs under a two-state potential-outcome simplification.

**Two-state simplification (audit gap G2 / review item A6).**
The paper (Goodman-Bacon 2021, Assumption 1) uses a full adoption-date-indexed
potential-outcome family `Y_{gt}(a)` where `a` ranges over `𝒯 ∪ {∞}`.  Each
cohort `g` has its own path `Y_g(A_g)` for every possible adoption date `a`, and
consistency is stated as `Y_{gt} = Y_{gt}(A_g)`.

This Lean layer flattens that family to two maps:
- `Y0 : 𝒢 → Fin T → ℝ` representing `Y(∞)` (the never-treated path), and
- `Y1 : 𝒢 → Fin T → ℝ` representing `Y(A_g)` (each cohort's own adoption-date path).

This simplification is **sufficient** for the three corollaries proved here
(`Δ_TN_eq_ATT`, `Δ_EL_eq_ATT`, `Δ_LE_eq_bad_comparison`), because Cor 5 of the
paper only ever references `Y_{gt}(A_g)` (own adoption date) or `Y_{gt}(∞)` (the
never-treated state).  The full adoption-date-indexed family `Y_{gt}(a)` is needed
only for more general heterogeneous-treatment comparisons across cohorts with
different adoption dates, which are outside the scope of Cor 5.

In particular, the LE bad-comparison result — showing that `Δ_LE` is contaminated
by `ATT_e(S1_LE) − ATT_e(S0_LE)` when early-treated cohorts serve as controls — is
fully captured by the two-state simplification.  To lift this to the paper's general
`Y_{gt}(a)` family one would introduce a type
`Y_full : 𝒢 → Fin T → WithTop (Fin T) → ℝ` and derive `Y0 g t = Y_full g t ⊤`
and `Y1 g t = Y_full g t (P.A g)` as special slices; this is deferred to a future
`AdoptionPath` module (see audit SH-3).

`Y0` denotes the never-treated path `Y(∞)`, while `Y1` denotes each cohort's
own adoption-date path `Y(A_g)`. This is sufficient for the LE bad-comparison
corollary proved here; it is not the full adoption-date-indexed family
`Y_gt(a)`.

* consistency `Y_{gt} = Y_{gt}(A_g)`,
* no anticipation `t < A_g → Y_{gt}(A_g) = Y_{gt}(∞)`,
* pairwise untreated parallel trends.

The three corollaries (NL doc A6 / LaTeX
`cor:po-estimand-goodman-bacon-causal-characterization`):

* `Δ_TN_eq_ATT` — `Δ_TN P g u = ATT_window Y0 Y1 g (S1_TN P g)`.
* `Δ_EL_eq_ATT` — `Δ_EL P e ℓ = ATT_window Y0 Y1 e (S1_EL P e ℓ)`.
* `Δ_LE_eq_bad_comparison` —
  `Δ_LE P e ℓ = ATT_window Y0 Y1 ℓ (S1_LE P e ℓ)
                  − (ATT_window Y0 Y1 e (S1_LE P e ℓ)
                      − ATT_window Y0 Y1 e (S0_LE P e ℓ))`.

Pure cell-level algebra: window means commute with sums, parallel trends
cancels untreated trends, and consistency + no-anticipation reduce factual
window means to potential-outcome window means. **No** dependence on
`prop:po-did-att`; the proofs are stated directly in terms of the window
mean operator `Ybar0` (the never-treated potential-outcome window mean).

/-! # Goodman-Bacon Causal Characterization

This file gives the causal layer of the Goodman-Bacon staggered-timing
decomposition. Under two-state potential-outcome assumptions, consistency, no
anticipation, and pairwise untreated parallel trends, it identifies the
treated-versus-never and early-versus-late contrasts with window-specific
average treatment effects and expresses the late-versus-early contrast with its
bad-comparison adjustment. -/

/-- Causal-side assumptions for the Goodman-Bacon decomposition (LaTeX
`ass:po-estimand-goodman-bacon-causal`), given a cohort panel `P` and potential-outcome maps
`Y0` (the never-treated path) and `Y1` (each cohort's own adoption-date path). It packages
[consistency on treated cells — the factual outcome equals the post-adoption potential outcome
once the cohort has adopted](hyp:consistencyTreated), [consistency on untreated cells — the
factual outcome equals the never-treated potential outcome before
adoption](hyp:consistencyUntreated), [no anticipation — the pre-adoption potential outcomes
under the two paths coincide](hyp:noAnticipation), and pairwise untreated parallel trends for
[the treated-versus-never comparison](hyp:parallelTrends_TN), [the
early-versus-late-before-late comparison](hyp:parallelTrends_EL), and [the
late-versus-early-after-early comparison](hyp:parallelTrends_LE).

**Two-state simplification (gap G2).** The paper uses a full adoption-date-indexed
family `Y_{gt}(a)`.  Here we use only two maps `Y0 = Y(∞)` and `Y1 = Y(A_g)`,
which suffices for Cor 5 (TN/EL ATT identification and the LE bad-comparison
corollary).  See the file header for a full discussion.

**Redundancy note.** `consistencyTreated` and `consistencyUntreated` together
with `noAnticipation` are slightly over-strong relative to the paper's single
consistency axiom `Y_{gt} = Y_{gt}(A_g)`: on pre-adoption cells, `consistencyUntreated`
gives `Y_{gt} = Y0 g t`, while `noAnticipation` gives `Y1 g t = Y0 g t`, so
together they imply `Y_{gt} = Y1 g t` on pre-adoption cells too.  The split is
kept because each field is used directly in downstream proofs. -/

1. The late cohort `ℓ` is untreated on `S0_LE P e ℓ = {A_e ≤ t < A_ℓ}` so
   `Ybar P ℓ (S0_LE P e ℓ) = Ybar0 Y0 ℓ …`.
2. On `S1_LE P ℓ = {A_ℓ ≤ t}`, `ℓ` is treated, so consistency gives

3. Cohort `e` is treated on both `S0_LE` and `S1_LE` (since `A_e < A_ℓ`
   means `A_e ≤ t` whenever `t ∈ S0_LE` or `t ∈ S1_LE`); decompose
   `Ybar P e S = Ybar0 Y0 e S + ATT_window Y0 Y1 e S` for each window.
4. Apply `parallelTrends_LE` to cancel `Ybar0 Y0 ℓ` differences against
   `Ybar0 Y0 e` differences; the residual ATT terms produce the
