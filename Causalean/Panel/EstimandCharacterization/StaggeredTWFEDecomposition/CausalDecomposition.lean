# Goodman-Bacon (2021): fused causal TWFE decomposition

**Role in the folder.** ★ *Causal headline — the paper's main result.* Adds the
potential-outcome layer on top of the algebraic headline
`AlgebraicDecomposition.lean`. See `StaggeredTWFEDecomposition.lean` for the
folder layer-map.

Fuses the algebraic Goodman-Bacon identity `twfe_eq_weighted_avg`
(`betaTWFE P = ∑ weight · contrast`) with the Layer C causal corollaries
(`Δ_TN_eq_ATT`, `Δ_EL_eq_ATT`, `Δ_LE_eq_bad_comparison`) into a single
statement: under the two-state potential-outcome assumptions
`CausalAssumptions P Y0 Y1`, the TWFE coefficient equals the totalized weighted
sum of the *potential-outcome* window contrasts `ATT_window Y0 Y1` (with the
late-versus-early bad-comparison adjustment). A weighted-average
interpretation additionally requires positive residualized-treatment variance.

/-! # Goodman-Bacon fused causal decomposition

This file composes the algebraic TWFE totalized weighted-sum identity with the
causal window-ATT corollaries, expressing the two-way fixed-effect coefficient
as a sum of normalized comparison weights times potential-outcome window
contrasts, with the late-versus-early bad-comparison term made explicit. A
weighted-average interpretation requires the separate positive-variance
condition used by `weights_sum_one`. -/

/-- For [a finite collection of cohorts whose members can be compared for equality](hyp:𝒢), [a natural-number panel length](hyp:T), [a cohort panel](hyp:P), [two potential-outcome paths, respectively under no treatment and under treatment at the cohort's own adoption date](hyp:Y0,Y1), and [a labelled ordered pair of cohorts](hyp:k), [the causal two-by-two contrast](goal) is zero when that comparison is inadmissible; otherwise, it is the relevant window average treatment effect for a treated-versus-never-treated or early-versus-late comparison, and for a late-versus-early comparison it is the late cohort's window average treatment effect minus the early cohort's corresponding treated-period effect net of its pre-period effect.

The **causal** 2x2 contrast on the full index `CompTag × 𝒢 × 𝒢`: on an
admissible comparison it returns the potential-outcome window contrast identified
by the Layer C corollaries — `ATT_window` for TN/EL and the bad-comparison
adjustment for LE — and `0` otherwise. This is the causal counterpart of the
algebraic `contrast`. -/

/-- **Fused causal Goodman-Bacon decomposition.** Fix a cohort panel `P` and potential-outcome
maps `Y0` (never-treated path) and `Y1` (own-adoption-date path). Assume [consistency on treated
and untreated cells, no anticipation, and pairwise untreated parallel trends across the
treated-versus-never, early-versus-late, and late-versus-early comparison types](hyp:hA); then
[the two-way fixed-effects coefficient `betaTWFE P` equals the sum, over admissible pairwise
comparisons, of each comparison's Goodman-Bacon weight times its potential-outcome window
contrast — the treated-versus-never and early-versus-late window-specific ATTs, or the
late-versus-early bad-comparison adjustment](goal).

The positive-variance hypothesis is the nondegenerate condition needed for the
normalized comparison weights to have their coefficient interpretation and sum
to one. -/
