# Goodman-Bacon (2021) Layer B: residualization witnesses

Builds the cohort + period residualization witnesses for `D` and `Y`
against `panelClass`. The orthogonality field is discharged by combining
per-axis orthogonality (`Support/Orthogonality.lean`) with the
`integral_mul_panelClass_eq_zero_of_axes` lemma in `Support/Integrals.lean`.

/-! # Goodman-Bacon Residualization Witnesses

This file constructs the residualization witnesses for treatment and outcome
after projecting on cohort and period cells in a balanced panel. These
witnesses package the fitted component, the residual component, square
integrability, decomposition, and orthogonality conditions used by the
Goodman-Bacon bridge. -/

/-- On [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω) with [a finite cohort label space whose members can be compared for equality and whose singleton sets are measurable](hyp:𝒢) and [a natural-number panel length](hyp:T), let [the probability measure](hyp:μ), [the treatment variable](hyp:D), [the cohort variable](hyp:G), and [the period variable](hyp:T_rv) be given. If [the cohort variable is measurable](hyp:G_meas), [the period variable is measurable](hyp:T_meas), [the treatment variable is measurable](hyp:D_meas), [the treatment variable equals either zero or one almost everywhere](hyp:D_binary), and [each cohort-period cell has probability equal to the product of its cohort and period marginal probabilities](hyp:B_balanced), then [the additive cohort-and-period treatment fit and its residual constitute a residualization witness for treatment with respect to the class of additive cohort-and-period functions](goal).

**B3. Residualization witness for `D`** against `panelClass`. With
`VH := panelPropensity μ D G T_rv` and `Vtilde ω := D ω - panelPropensity ω`,
this packages the four witness obligations:

* `VH_mem` — `panelPropensity` lies in `panelClass` (by
  `panelPropensity_mem_panelClass`).
* `Vtilde_memLp` — `D - panelPropensity ∈ MemLp 2 μ` (D is bounded; class
  members are in `MemLp 2`).
* `decomp` — `D = panelPropensity + (D - panelPropensity)` pointwise.
* `orthogonal` — `∫ (D - panelPropensity) · h dμ = 0` for every
  `h ∈ panelClass`. Discharged by combining
  `residD_cohort_orthogonal` and `residD_period_orthogonal` via
  `integral_mul_panelClass_eq_zero_of_axes`. **Requires the balanced-cell
  hypothesis `B_balanced`.** -/
