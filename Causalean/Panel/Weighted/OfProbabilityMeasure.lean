# Weighted support from a finite probability measure

Bridge connecting the finite weighted-support tower (`Causalean/Panel/Weighted/*`) to a
probability measure on a finite measurable space.  For a probability measure `μ`
on a `Fintype` `R` with measurable singletons, the point masses
`ω_r := (μ {r}).toReal` form a `WeightedSupport R` whose observed set is the
positive-mass support, and the weighted inner product coincides with the
`L²(μ)` integral pairing:

    ⟨A, B⟩_ω  =  ∫ A·B dμ.

This lets the measure-theoretic cell-bridge layer (`Residualization` /
`CellBridge`) and the finite weighted-support FWL tower (`Weighted/FWL`) be used
interchangeably on a finite probability space.

/-! # Weighted supports from probability measures

This file connects the finite weighted-support algebra to probability measures
on finite measurable spaces. The construction `ofProbabilityMeasure` turns point
masses into a `WeightedSupport` whose observed set is the positive-mass support,
and `ofProbabilityMeasure_weight` exposes the resulting atom weights.

The main bridge theorem, `ip_eq_integral`, identifies the finite weighted inner
product with the corresponding `L²(μ)` integral pairing. This lets
measure-theoretic cell bridges and finite weighted-support Frisch-Waugh-Lovell
arguments be used interchangeably on a finite probability space. -/

/-- For [a finite measurable record space in which every singleton is measurable](hyp:R) and [a probability measure](hyp:μ), the [weighted support induced by that probability measure](goal) has as observed records exactly those with strictly positive point mass and assigns each record its point mass as weight.

A probability measure on a finite measurable space induces a weighted support whose weights are point masses and whose observed records have positive mass.

The observed set is the positive-mass support. -/
