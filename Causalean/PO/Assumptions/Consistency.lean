/-! # Consistency for Potential Outcomes

This file defines the pathwise agreement predicates and the two-clause consistency
assumption for potential-outcome systems.  These notions connect factual agreement,
sequential interventions, and equality of potential outcomes outside the intervened
coordinates.  The public API consists of `POSystem.FactualAgrees`,
`POSystem.IntermediateAgrees`, and the `POSystem.Consistency` structure with its
factual-consistency and composition-consistency fields. -/

variable (P : POSystem)

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P), [an intervention regime](hyp:r), and [a unit in its sample space](hyp:ω), [factual agreement](goal) means that every variable targeted by the regime has, for that unit under the factual regime, exactly the value assigned by the intervention.

For a potential-outcome system, an intervention regime, and a unit in the
sample space, factual agreement means that for every variable targeted by the
regime, the factual value of that variable for the unit equals the value assigned
by the regime.

Pathwise predicate: factual value of `r.target` equals `r.assign` at `ω`. -/
def FactualAgrees (r : Regime P.V P.X) (ω : P.Ω) : Prop :=
  ∀ v (hv : v ∈ r.target), P.eval Regime.empty ω v = r.assign v hv

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P), [a first intervention regime](hyp:r₁), [a second intervention regime](hyp:r₂), and [a unit in its sample space](hyp:ω), [intermediate agreement](goal) means that, after the first intervention, every variable targeted by the second has exactly the value assigned by the second.

For a potential-outcome system, two intervention regimes, and a unit in the
sample space, intermediate agreement means that after applying the first regime,
every variable targeted by the second regime has the value assigned to it by the
second regime.

Pathwise predicate: post-`r₁` value of `r₂.target` equals `r₂.assign` at `ω`. -/
def IntermediateAgrees (r₁ r₂ : Regime P.V P.X) (ω : P.Ω) : Prop :=
  ∀ v (hv : v ∈ r₂.target), P.eval r₁ ω v = r₂.assign v hv

/-- A potential-outcome system is consistent when two conditions hold. First,
[for every intervention regime and every finite set of variables disjoint from the
regime's target, a unit's potential outcomes for that set under the regime equal its
factual potential outcomes whenever it factually agrees with the regime](hyp:factual).
Second, [for every pair of disjoint regimes and every finite set of variables disjoint
from the union of their targets, a unit's potential outcomes for that set under the
composed regime equal its potential outcomes under the first regime alone, whenever it
agrees with the second regime after the first has been applied](hyp:composition).
