# Potential Outcome System

Implements def:po-system and def:po-operator from Basic Concepts.tex:
a graph-free tuple `(V, {X_v}, Ω, μ, {v(r)})` together with the derived
world-eval map and the PO operator (pushforward).

/-! # Potential Outcome Systems

This file defines a graph-free potential-outcome system, its coordinate-level
potential outcomes, subset-valued potential outcomes, and the induced
pushforward law of a subset under a regime. These are the base objects used by
the counterfactual and identification layers of the library. -/

/-- A potential-outcome system consists of [a finite set of variables](hyp:V,decEqV,fintypeV),
[a measurable value space for each variable](hyp:X,measX), [a measurable sample space](hyp:Ω,measΩ)
carrying [a probability measure](hyp:μ,isProb), and, for every intervention regime and sample
point, [a jointly measurable assignment of potential-outcome values to all
variables](hyp:eval,measurable_eval).

variable (P : POSystem)

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P), [an intervention regime](hyp:r), and [a variable](hyp:v), the [coordinate potential outcome](goal) assigns to each unit the value that variable would take under that intervention.

A coordinate potential outcome maps each unit to the value a selected
variable would take under a selected intervention regime.

Implements the per-coordinate part of def:po-operator. -/
def component (r : Regime P.V P.X) (v : P.V) : P.Ω → P.X v :=
  fun ω => P.eval r ω v

/-- At a given unit, the coordinate potential outcome of a variable under a
regime is the system's world evaluation of that variable at that unit under
that regime.

This is the simp-shaped form of the definition of the coordinate potential
outcome: rewriting with it replaces the project constant by the system's own
evaluation map. -/

/-- For [an intervention regime `r`](hyp:r) and [a variable `v`](hyp:v), [the
coordinate potential outcome of `v` under `r` is a measurable function of the
unit](goal). -/

lemma measurable_component (r : Regime P.V P.X) (v : P.V) :
    Measurable (P.component r v) :=
  (measurable_pi_apply v).comp (P.measurable_eval r)

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P), [an intervention regime](hyp:r), and [a finite set of variables](hyp:Y), the [joint potential outcome](goal) assigns to each unit the vector of values that all variables in the set would take under that intervention.

A joint potential outcome maps each unit to the vector of values a selected
finite set of variables would take under a selected intervention regime.

Implements the subset-valued variable in def:po-operator. -/
def poVariable (r : Regime P.V P.X) (Y : Finset P.V) :
    P.Ω → ValuesOn Y P.X :=
  fun ω v => P.eval r ω v.val

/-- Reading off one coordinate of the joint potential outcome of a finite
variable set under a regime gives the system's world evaluation of that
coordinate's variable, at the same unit and under the same regime.

This is the simp-shaped form of the definition of the joint potential outcome:
rewriting with it replaces the project constant by the system's own evaluation
map. -/

intervention regime is measurable. -/

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P), [an intervention regime](hyp:r), and [a finite set of variables](hyp:Y), the [potential-outcome law](goal) is the distribution of those variables' joint potential outcome under that intervention, induced by the system's probability measure.

A potential-outcome law is the distribution of a selected finite set of
variables under a selected intervention regime.

Implements def:po-operator. -/
noncomputable def poOperator (r : Regime P.V P.X) (Y : Finset P.V) :
    Measure (ValuesOn Y P.X) :=
  (P.μ).map (P.poVariable r Y)

/-- The potential-outcome law of a finite variable set under a regime is the
pushforward of the system's probability measure along the joint potential
outcome for that set and regime.

This is the simp-shaped form of the definition of the potential-outcome law:
rewriting with it replaces the project constant by an explicit pushforward
measure, after which the pushforward API applies. -/

and [a finite set of variables](hyp:Y), [the distribution of those variables'
joint potential outcome under that regime](goal) is a probability measure.

The potential-outcome law of a finite set of variables under a regime is a
