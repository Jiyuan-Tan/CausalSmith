/-! # Potential-Outcome Variables

This file packages a variable of a potential-outcome system together with a
common measurable value space, so that factual and counterfactual realizations
can be handled uniformly.  It also provides event indicators and variables
paired with intervention regimes for counterfactual independence statements.

The main public objects are `POVar`, its factual and counterfactual value maps
`factual`, `cf`, and `cfUnder`, the factual-event indicator API, and
`RegimedVar` for bundling a variable with the regime under which it is evaluated. -/

/-- A potential-outcome variable records [a system variable](hyp:v) together with
[a measurable relabeling of its native value space into a chosen analysis scale
`α`](hyp:equiv).

A PO system variable whose value space is identified with a fixed measurable
type `α` via a measurable equivalence.  Bundles the underlying node `v : P.V`
together with the equivalence, so that factual and counterfactual realisations
land in `α` rather than `P.X v`. -/

the system's world evaluation of that variable at that unit under that regime,
carried over to the analysis scale by the variable's measurable equivalence.

This is the simp-shaped form of the definition of the counterfactual value
function: rewriting with it replaces the project constant by the system's own
evaluation map. -/

The three indicator lemmas above are stated for a `MeasurableSet {x}` side
condition and, in the strongly-measurable case, for the σ-algebra generated by
the variable's factual value.  The corollaries below restate them in the two
shapes the standard function-property tactics look for: strong measurability
against the ambient σ-algebra, and the side-condition-free form available when
the value space has measurable one-point sets. -/
