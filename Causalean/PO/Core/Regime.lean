# Intervention Regimes for the Bare Potential Outcome Framework

Represents `r = (X, x)` from Basic Concepts.tex, def:po-system.  A regime
names a finite target set of variables together with an assignment of
values on that set.  No graph and no SCM structure is assumed.

/-! # Intervention Regimes

This file defines finite intervention regimes for the potential-outcome
framework. A regime records the variables fixed by an intervention and the
assigned value for each fixed variable, without assuming a graph or structural
causal model. -/

/-- An intervention regime specifies [a finite set of targeted variables](hyp:target)
together with [an assigned value in the corresponding value space for each targeted
variable](hyp:assign).

`r = (target, assign)` in def:po-system. -/

/-- For [a collection of variables whose identities can be compared](hyp:V) and [their value spaces](hyp:X), [the empty intervention regime](goal) targets no variable and consequently has no substantive assignments.

def:po-consistency. -/
