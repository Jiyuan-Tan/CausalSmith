/-! # Cross-World Counterfactual Distributions

This file constructs finite joint distributions of potential outcomes evaluated
under possibly different intervention regimes.  It supplies the cross-world
evaluation map, its pushforward law, and the basic marginal reading of that law. -/

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P) and [a finite ordered list of queries, each consisting of an intervention regime and a finite variable set](hyp:qs), the [cross-world evaluation map](goal) assigns to every unit the tuple whose $i$th component is the joint potential outcome for the $i$th query.

For a potential-outcome system, a finite list of queries, and a unit in the
sample space, this function returns the tuple whose $i$th component is the
potential outcome, for the finite variable set in the $i$th query, under the
intervention regime in the $i$th query.

Cross-world evaluation: a tuple of `Y_i(r_i)(ω)` for a finite list of queries.

/-- Reading off the `i`-th coordinate of the cross-world evaluation of a unit
returns the joint potential outcome of the `i`-th query's variable set under the
`i`-th query's regime, at that same unit.

This is the simp-shaped form of the definition of cross-world evaluation:
rewriting with it replaces the tuple-valued map by the single-query potential
outcome, after which the potential-outcome API applies. -/

/-- For [a potential-outcome system](hyp:P) and [a finite ordered list of counterfactual queries](hyp:qs), the [joint counterfactual distribution](goal) is the probability measure induced by applying the cross-world evaluation map to a random unit drawn from the system's probability measure.

For a potential-outcome system and a finite list of counterfactual queries,
the counterfactual distribution is the probability measure obtained by pushing
the system's probability measure on the sample space through the cross-world
evaluation map for those queries.
