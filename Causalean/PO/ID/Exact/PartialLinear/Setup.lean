# Partially linear model under the backdoor PO framework (continuous treatment)

This file sets up the partially linear regression (PLR) model as a causal model
inside the potential-outcome framework, with a **real-valued (continuous)
treatment** `D ∈ ℝ`.  It parallels `POBackdoorSystem` (binary treatment) in
`PO/ID/Exact/ATE.lean`, swapping the treatment's value space `Bool → ℝ`.

* `POPartialLinearSystem` — the bare PO substrate: a real treatment node `D`, a
  real outcome node `Y`, a covariate variable `X`, plus the value-space equivs
  and the distinctness of the three nodes.  Derived: `YofD d` (the potential
  outcome `Y(d)`), the factual `D/Y/X`, and the σ-algebras `σ(X)`, `σ(X,D)`.
* `POPartialLinearModel` — adds the *homogeneous linear dose-response* structural
  restriction `Y(d) = b(X) + θ·d + U`, the standard backdoor assumption stated in
  conditional-mean form `E[U | σ(X,D)] = 0`, and consistency `Y = Y(D)`.
* `factualY_eq` — the observed-data form `Y = b(X) + θ·D + U`.
* `causal_homogeneity` — the causal reading `Y(d) − Y(d') = θ·(d − d')`.

/-! # Partially Linear Model Setup

This file provides the potential-outcome substrate for the partially linear
model with a real-valued treatment. `POPartialLinearSystem` records the
treatment, outcome, and covariate nodes; packages them as `dVar`, `yVar`, and
`xVar`; defines potential outcomes `YofD`, factual maps, and the sigma-algebras
`sigmaX` and `sigmaXD`; and proves the measurability and inclusion lemmas used
by the identification proof.

`POPartialLinearModel` adds the homogeneous structural restriction
`Y(d) = b(X) + theta * d + U`, a conditional-mean backdoor assumption, and
consistency. Its two exported consequences are `factualY_eq`, the observed-data
regression form, and `causal_homogeneity`, the constant per-unit causal effect
identity. -/

[a real-valued treatment node `D`](hyp:D,hDreal), [a real-valued outcome node `Y`](hyp:Y,hYreal),
and [a covariate variable `X` taking values in an arbitrary measurable space](hyp:Xvar), subject
to [the treatment, outcome, and covariate being pairwise distinct](hyp:hDY,hDX,hYX). This mirrors
the binary backdoor subsystem but the treatment now ranges over the real line, as required by the
partially linear model `Y = g(X) + θ·D + noise`. -/
