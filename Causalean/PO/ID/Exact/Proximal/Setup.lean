/-! # Proximal Setup

This file defines the data layer for proximal average treatment effect
identification. `POProximalSystem` records a covariate, binary treatment,
treatment-side proxy, outcome-side proxy, real-valued outcome, and latent
confounder. The namespace then supplies the factual maps `X`, `A`, `Z`, `W`,
`Y`, and `U`; the treatment-specific potential outcome `YofA`; tuple-valued
conditioning targets `AZX`, `AUX`, `UX`, and `AZUX`; and the generated
sigma-algebras `σ_AZX`, `σ_AUX`, `σ_UX`, and `σ_AZUX` with their ambient
sub-sigma-algebra lemmas.

Assumption bundles and the identification theorem are kept in the companion
`Proximal.Assumptions` and `Proximal.Main` files. -/

/-! ### Generator measurability

Each conditioning σ-algebra is generated by a tuple, so every coordinate of that tuple —
and the tuple itself — is measurable with respect to it. These are the atoms a proof needs
in order to build any further σ-restricted measurability claim, and they are the facts a
prover previously had to re-derive by unfolding the comap by hand. Registering them makes
the whole family reachable by a bare `fun_prop`. -/
