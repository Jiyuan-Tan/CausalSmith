# One orientation of the asymptotic Imbens-Manski pointwise confidence argument

The finite-sample honest interval of `Inference/IntervalCI.lean` protects *both*
endpoints two-sidedly, paying a Bonferroni price (`1 − δ_L − δ_U`).  Imbens and
Manski (2004) observed that when the identified set `[L, U]` has *positive width*
`Δ = U − L > 0`, covering the single true value `θ₀ ∈ [L, U]` (rather than the
whole set) needs protection on only **one** side: as `n → ∞` the sampling error
`O(n^{-1/2})` is negligible relative to the fixed width `Δ`, so the non-coverage
risk is one-sided.  Hence a *one-sided* critical value `c = z_{1−α}` already
delivers `1 − α` coverage of `θ₀`, where the set-coverage interval would need the
two-sided `z_{1−α/2}` (cf. Stoye 2009, and Molinari 2020 §"Pointwise vs. Uniform
Coverage"; Imbens–Manski 2004, Lemma 1).

This file formalizes the lower-protected, upper-far endpoint orientation of that
argument. The proved coverage theorem uses the lower endpoint's normal limit at
the fixed one-sided cutoff and assumes the upper endpoint's far-tail failure
probability vanishes; the symmetric upper-protected orientation is not supplied
here.

## Normalization

Write the (studentized) endpoint statistics

    Sₗ,ₙ = √n (θ̂ₗ,ₙ − L) / σₗ,    Sᵤ,ₙ = √n (θ̂ᵤ,ₙ − U) / σᵤ,

each converging in distribution to `N(0,1)`.  For a fixed `θ₀ ∈ [L, U]` put the
nonnegative normalized offsets

    aₙ = √n (θ₀ − L) / σₗ ≥ 0,    bₙ = √n (U − θ₀) / σᵤ ≥ 0.

A direct computation shows the Imbens–Manski interval
`[θ̂ₗ,ₙ − c σₗ/√n, θ̂ᵤ,ₙ + c σᵤ/√n]` covers `θ₀` exactly when

    Sₗ,ₙ ≤ c + aₙ    and    −(c + bₙ) ≤ Sᵤ,ₙ.

The theorem below treats the case where the upper offset `bₙ` is the far endpoint:
its vanishing-failure hypothesis says the event `Sᵤ,ₙ < −(c + bₙ)` has probability
tending to zero. The helper `farEnd_vanishes_of_tendsto_atBot` discharges this
when the moving upper threshold tends to `−∞`, as happens when `bₙ → ∞`.

## Main results

* `gaussianMeasure_zero_one_frontier_Iic` — the standard normal gives zero mass to
  the boundary `{c}` of a closed half-line `(-∞, c]`.
* `imbensManski_pointwise_coverage` — **the lower-protected asymptotic
  guarantee.** If `Sₗ ⇒ N(0,1)`, the offsets `aₙ ≥ 0`, and the far upper endpoint
  fails with vanishing probability, then for every `ε > 0` the Imbens–Manski coverage
  probability of `θ₀` eventually exceeds `Φ(c) − ε`, where `Φ(c) = N(0,1)((-∞,c])`.
  Taking `c = z_{1−α}` (so `Φ(c) = 1 − α`) gives asymptotic coverage `≥ 1 − α`.
* `farEnd_vanishes_of_tendsto_atBot` — discharges the far-endpoint hypothesis: if
  `Sᵤ ⇒ N(0,1)` and the threshold `−(c + bₙ) → −∞` (i.e. `bₙ → ∞`, the `Δ > 0`
  regime), then `P(Sᵤ,ₙ < −(c + bₙ)) → 0`.  This is where positivity of the width
  enters, via the Gaussian tail bound `finite_measure_halfline_tails_small`.

For this endpoint orientation, the two-sided-vs-one-sided gain is made precise:
the limiting lower bound is `Φ(c)` for a *one-sided* `c`, not `Φ(c) − Φ(−c)`.
Uniformity over `P` (Stoye's refinement, requiring superefficient estimation of
the nuisance width) and the symmetric upper-protected theorem are not addressed
here.

/-! # Imbens-Manski Asymptotic Confidence Intervals

This file formalizes the lower-protected, upper-far orientation of the asymptotic
one-sided critical-value argument for confidence intervals covering a true scalar
parameter inside an identified interval. It relates lower-endpoint convergence
and vanishing upper far-tail failure to the Imbens-Manski parameter-coverage
refinement.

The helper `gaussianMeasure_zero_one_frontier_Iic` supplies the continuity-point
fact needed for portmanteau at a closed half-line. The theorem
`farEnd_vanishes_of_tendsto_atBot` proves that a normalized endpoint statistic
with a standard-normal limit has vanishing probability below a threshold tending
to `-infinity`. The main theorem `imbensManski_pointwise_coverage` combines the
lower endpoint's normal limit, a nonnegative lower offset, and the far-endpoint
tail condition to show eventual coverage at least `Phi(c) - epsilon` for the
one-sided critical value `c`.

Only this endpoint orientation is formalized here; the symmetric
upper-protected statement and uniform-in-distribution refinements are outside
this file. -/

If the normalized upper-endpoint statistic `Sᵤ ⇒ N(0,1)` and the (signed)
threshold drifts to `−∞`, then the probability that `Sᵤ,ₙ` falls below it tends to
`0`.  Concretely `tₙ = −(c + bₙ)` with `bₙ → ∞` (the positive-width regime);
the proof bounds the moving tail by a fixed Gaussian tail `N(0,1)((-∞,-R])` made
arbitrarily small via `finite_measure_halfline_tails_small`, then transported by portmanteau. -/

/-- **Lower-protected Imbens-Manski pointwise coverage.** Let `Sl`, `Su` be the normalized
lower- and upper-endpoint statistics for an interval-identified scalar parameter, with
[`Sl n` measurable for every sample size `n`](hyp:hSl), [`Su n` measurable for every sample
size `n`](hyp:hSu), and [`Sl` converging in distribution to the standard normal
law](hyp:hSld). Fix a one-sided critical value `c`. Suppose [the normalized lower offset
`aL n`, of the target point inside the identified interval, is nonnegative for every
`n`](hyp:haL), and [the far-endpoint failure probability — that `Su n` falls below
`-(c + bU n)` — tends to zero as `n → ∞`](hyp:hfar). Then for [any positive
tolerance `ε`](hyp:hε), [eventually, as `n → ∞`, the probability that the Imbens-Manski
interval covers the target point is at least `Φ(c) − ε`, where `Φ` is the standard-normal
distribution function](goal).

Here `Sl` is the normalized lower-endpoint statistic, `Su` is the normalized
upper-endpoint statistic, `c` is the one-sided critical value, `aL` is the
nonnegative lower offset of the point inside the interval, and `bU` is the upper
offset. The conclusion says that the event

    Sl n ≤ c + aL n  and  -(c + bU n) ≤ Su n

has probability at least `Φ(c) - ε` for all sufficiently large `n`, where `Φ` is
the standard-normal distribution function. This theorem is one endpoint
orientation only; it does not claim simultaneous coverage over the whole
identified set or supply the symmetric upper-protected orientation. -/
