# Lee bounds: principal-stratum events

The latent (counterfactual) events `alwaysSelected = {Sel(0)=true, Sel(1)=true}`
and `helpedSelected = {Sel(0)=false, Sel(1)=true}`.  Under monotone sample
selection, these two events partition the latent selected set
`{Sel(1)=true}`, and the "selected under control" event `{Sel(0)=true}`
collapses (a.s.) to `alwaysSelected` because `{Sel(0)=true, Sel(1)=false}`
has measure zero.

This file proves the two key event-equality lemmas via leaf-level
measure-theoretic rewrites.

/-! # Lee Principal Strata

This file defines the latent principal strata for Lee sample-selection bounds.
It proves measurability and the monotone-selection event identities that relate
the always-selected and treatment-induced-selected strata to observed and
counterfactual selected sets. -/

/-! ### Monotone-selection identities

These are the two key a.s. identities the main Lee-bounds proof consumes.
Both are leaf-level measure-theoretic rewrites: monotone selection states
`SelOfA false ω ≤ SelOfA true ω` a.s., which forces `harmedSelected` to be
null, and the two displayed equalities follow.

Note: `MonotoneSelection` lives in `Assumptions.lean`; we take the raw a.s.
predicate `(∀ᵐ ω, S.SelOfA false ω ≤ S.SelOfA true ω)` as a hypothesis here
to keep this file dependency-free of `Assumptions.lean`. -/

/-- If [sample selection is monotone, i.e. selection under control implies selection under
treatment almost surely (`Sel(0) ≤ Sel(1)`)](hyp:hMono), then [the harmed-selected stratum —
units who would be selected under control but not under treatment — has probability
zero](goal). -/

  -- The target equality is `{ω | SelOfA false ω = true} =ᵐ alwaysSelected`.
