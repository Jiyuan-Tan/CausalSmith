# Balke-Pearl IV bounds: attainment of the closed-form endpoints

`ClosedForm.lean` proves the closed-form endpoints are *valid* — every feasible
latent table has objective inside `[bpLower, bpUpper]`. This file proves they are
*attained*: some feasible table achieves each endpoint, which upgrades the
containment to an equality and makes the closed form the exact LP optimum. The
capstone is `bpLower_bpUpper_eq_csInf_csSup`.

Do not confuse this with `Sharp.lean`. That file proves a different statement, on
the model side: every feasible latent table is realized by an actual PO model, so
the identified interval is exactly the LP objective range. The present file is
purely about the linear program — that the max of eight affine expressions equals
the LP optimum. Both are needed for the closed form to be a sharp bound on the ATE.

The witnesses here are the primal optima corresponding to the eight dual vertices,
found by complementary slackness. That derivation is offline scaffolding only: no
duality theory enters the proofs, each witness is an explicit table and is checked
directly against the feasibility constraints.

the closed-form lower bound `bpLower`](goal). -/

IV base assumptions](hyp:hA), [the supremum of the Balke-Pearl identified interval equals
the closed-form upper bound `bpUpper`](goal). -/

/-! ### Sharpness of the closed form -/

/-- **The Balke-Pearl closed form is sharp.** Under [the Balke-Pearl IV base
assumptions](hyp:hA), [the interval `[bpLower, bpUpper]`, computed from the observed cell
probabilities alone, has both endpoints attained by observationally-equivalent latent
tables — equivalently, `bpLower` is the infimum and `bpUpper` is the supremum of the
Balke-Pearl identified interval](goal). So no smaller interval contains every average
treatment effect compatible with the data: the bound cannot be improved without further
assumptions. -/

    S.bpLower = sInf (S.BPIdentifiedInterval hA) ∧
