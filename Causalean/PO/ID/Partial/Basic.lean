/-! # Partial Identification Basics

This file provides abstract infrastructure for scalar partial-identification
intervals. It defines the identified interval as the set of objective values
attainable over a feasible parameter set and proves general criteria for
placing that set inside, or identifying it exactly with, a closed real
interval.

The results are independent of the potential-outcome framework and are reused
by concrete bound constructions such as Balke-Pearl intervals. -/

/-- For [a parameter space](hyp:α), [an objective function](hyp:obj), and [a feasibility condition on its parameter
values](hyp:feasible), the [sharp identified interval](goal) is the set of all objective
values attained by feasible parameters.

Sharp identified interval: the set of all objective values attainable by
a feasible parameter. -/
noncomputable def IdentifiedInterval {α : Type*} (obj : α → ℝ) (feasible : α → Prop) : Set ℝ :=
  Set.range (fun x : {x // feasible x} => obj x)

/-- A feasible parameter's objective value belongs to the identified interval. -/

  ⟨⟨x, hx⟩, rfl⟩

/-- **Sandwich → membership.**  The literal content of a two-sided bound
`L ≤ θ ≤ U`: the target functional `θ` lies in the reported interval `[L, U]`.
Names the step that turns the inequality pair every concrete bound produces into
the `Set.Icc` vocabulary. -/
theorem mem_Icc_of_sandwich {θ L U : ℝ} (hlo : L ≤ θ) (hhi : θ ≤ U) :
    θ ∈ Set.Icc L U :=
  ⟨hlo, hhi⟩

/-- **Worst/best case over a nuisance.**  If a set `s ⊆ ℝ` is bounded, every one
of its members lies between `sInf s` and `sSup s`.  Applied with `s = range obj`
this is the engine form of "the truth is bracketed by the extreme feasible
values". -/

    (hb : BddBelow s) (ha : BddAbove s) (hy : y ∈ s) :
    y ∈ Set.Icc (sInf s) (sSup s) :=
  ⟨csInf_le hb hy, le_csSup ha hy⟩

variable {α : Type*} {obj : α → ℝ} {feasible : α → Prop}

/-- **Outer bound.**  If the objective is uniformly bounded below by `L` and
above by `U` over the feasible set, the sharp identified interval is contained
in `[L, U]`. -/
theorem identifiedInterval_subset_Icc {L U : ℝ}
    (hL : ∀ x, feasible x → L ≤ obj x) (hU : ∀ x, feasible x → obj x ≤ U) :
    IdentifiedInterval obj feasible ⊆ Set.Icc L U := by
  rintro _ ⟨x, rfl⟩
  exact ⟨hL x.1 x.2, hU x.1 x.2⟩

/-- **Sharp interval (order-connected form).** For an abstract objective function over a
feasible parameter set, suppose [the objective is bounded below by `L` on every feasible
parameter](hyp:hL), [bounded above by `U` on every feasible parameter](hyp:hU), [the value
`L` itself is attained by some feasible parameter](hyp:hLmem), [the value `U` itself is
attained by some feasible parameter](hyp:hUmem), and [the set of attainable objective
values is order-connected — it contains every real number between any two of its
members](hyp:hconn). Then [the identified interval — the set of all objective values
attainable over the feasible parameter set — equals the closed interval `[L, U]`
exactly](goal). Order-connectedness is the abstract substitute for "no gaps", supplied
concretely by `identifiedInterval_param_Icc` through continuity + connectedness of a
parameterization. -/

    (hL : ∀ x, feasible x → L ≤ obj x) (hU : ∀ x, feasible x → obj x ≤ U)
    (hLmem : L ∈ IdentifiedInterval obj feasible)
    (hUmem : U ∈ IdentifiedInterval obj feasible)
    (hconn : (IdentifiedInterval obj feasible).OrdConnected) :
    IdentifiedInterval obj feasible = Set.Icc L U :=
  Set.Subset.antisymm (identifiedInterval_subset_Icc hL hU) (hconn.out hLmem hUmem)

/-- **Mixing-pattern constructor.** Suppose [the feasible parameter set is exactly the
image of the unit interval `[0, 1]` under a path `γ`](hyp:hfeas), [the objective composed
with `γ` is continuous on `[0, 1]`](hyp:hcont), [the objective value at the path's start
equals `L`](hyp:hL), [the objective value at the path's end equals `U`](hyp:hU), and [the
objective stays between `L` and `U` at every point along the path](hyp:hbound). Then [the
sharp identified interval is exactly `[L, U]`](goal). This is the canonical
partial-identification "mixing" shape: an unidentified nuisance ranging over a connected
parameter set sweeps the objective continuously across the whole interval between its
extreme values. -/
