# Finite-grid support-process tail tests

Built directly on the finite-grid support-process CLT
`setValued_supportProcess_clt` (`SupportProcess.lean`).  Beresteanu & Molinari
(2008, Thm 2.2) motivate a specification test of the null

    H₀ : E[F] = EF

for a set-valued random variable `F`.  This file formalizes the algebraic
finite-grid proxy built from the normalized sum of the centered support process.
Over a fixed grid of `k` directions `p₀,…,p_{k-1}` the statistic is the `ℓ^∞`
functional of those normalized support-process coordinates.  When the separate
Minkowski-mean bridge hypotheses are available, this proxy can be related to

    Tₙ = maxⱼ √n · |s(pⱼ, F̄ₙ) − s(pⱼ, EF)|,

but the declarations below state and prove results for the normalized
support-process statistic itself.  Under the mean-zero / Artstein hypothesis
`∫ ψ = 0` of the support process, the CLT gives convergence to `‖z‖_∞` over the
grid for the finite-dimensional Gaussian limit `z`, so the rejection probability
converges to the limit-law tail `L(c, ∞)`.  Choosing `c` as the `(1−α)`-quantile
of the limit law `L` (a
continuity point, so `L{c} = 0`) delivers an asymptotic level-`α` test.

## Main definitions

* `gridTestStat` — the two-sided normalized support-process statistic.
* `gridTestReject` — the rejection region `{ω | c < Tₙ ω}` at critical value `c`.

## Main results

* `gridTestStat_clt` — under the mean-zero hypothesis, the statistic converges
  in distribution to the law
  `(gaussianLimit ψ).map maxAbsK` of `maxⱼ |z(pⱼ)|`; a thin restatement of
  `setValued_supportProcess_clt`.
* `gridTest_asymptotic_level` — under `H₀`, at any continuity point `c` of the
  limit law, the rejection probability `μ (gridTestReject … c)` converges to the
  limit-law tail `L(c, ∞)`.  Proved by portmanteau on the open half-line `Ioi c`.

/-! # Finite-Grid Specification Tests for Random Sets

This file formulates finite-grid specification tests for the Aumann expectation
of a set-valued random variable using the normalized centered support process.
The statistic is the gridwise supremum of that normalized support-process sum,
and its asymptotic level follows from the finite-direction support-process
central limit theorem.

Main declarations:
* `gridTestStat` is the finite-grid `l^\infty` statistic applied to the
  normalized centered support-process sum.
* `gridTestReject` is the rejection region `{T_n > c}`.
* `gridTestStat_clt` transports the support-process CLT through the grid
  supremum functional.
* `gridTest_asymptotic_level` identifies the limiting rejection probability at
  continuity points of the Gaussian limit law.

/-- **Asymptotic level of the finite-grid tail test.** At [any continuity point `c` of the
Gaussian limit law of the grid test statistic](hyp:hfront) — i.e. the limit law assigns
zero mass to `{c}` — [the tail (rejection) probability of the normalized finite-grid
support-process statistic converges to the corresponding tail mass of the Gaussian limit
law](goal): `μ (gridTestReject … c) → L(c, ∞)`.

Under the mean-zero hypothesis, at any continuity point `c` of the limit law
`L = (gaussianLimit ψ).map maxAbsK` (i.e. `L{c} = 0`), the rejection probability
converges to the limit-law tail:

    μ (gridTestReject … c)  →  L(c, ∞).

Choosing `c` as the `(1−α)`-quantile of `L` (a continuity point) makes the right
side `α`, giving an asymptotic level-`α` test.  Proof: the rejection event is
`{Tₙ ∈ Ioi c}`, so the conclusion is portmanteau
(`tendsto_measure_of_null_frontier_of_tendsto'`) on the open half-line `Ioi c`,
whose frontier `{c}` is null by the continuity-point hypothesis. -/
