# Finite-direction support-process CLT (Beresteanu–Molinari 2008, Theorem A.2)

The Tier-2 capstone of the random-set program, the general-`d` analogue of the
scalar interval CLT (`IntervalCLT.lean`).  Beresteanu–Molinari Theorem A.2 states
the support-function-process CLT

    √n · H((1/n)⊕Fᵢ, E[F])  ⇒  ‖z‖_{C(Sᵈ⁻¹)}

for a Gaussian process `z` on the unit sphere with covariance
`Cov(z(p),z(q)) = E[s(p,F)s(q,F)] − E[s(p,F)]E[s(q,F)]`.  The genuine continuum
`C(Sᵈ⁻¹)` Banach CLT is a deferred Mathlib gap.

This file proves the **honest finite-dimensional projection**: fix a finite set of
`k` directions `p₀,…,p_{k-1}` and consider the centered support process
`ψ(z)_j = s(pⱼ, F(z)) − E s(pⱼ, F)`, valued in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`.  The
Hausdorff-over-grid statistic is the `ℓ^∞` functional `maxAbsK`, and the
support-process vector CLT plus continuous mapping give

    √n · maxⱼ |s(pⱼ,·)-process|  ⇒  ‖z‖_∞ over the grid,

the law of `maxAbsK` of the `k`-variate Gaussian limit.  This is the exact
generalization of `normalizedSum_maxAbs_clt` (the `Fin 2` `maxAbs` CLT).

## Main results

* `maxAbsK` / `continuous_maxAbsK` / `measurable_maxAbsK` — the `ℓ^∞`/Hausdorff-
  over-grid functional `w ↦ supⱼ |wⱼ|` on `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`.
* `supportProcess_sup_clt` — the abstract continuous-mapping CLT: `maxAbsK` of the
  vector normalised sum of the centered support process converges in distribution
  to `(gaussianLimit ψ).map maxAbsK`.

/-! # Finite-Direction Support-Process Central Limit Theorem

This file proves the finite-dimensional support-process central limit theorem
for random compact convex sets evaluated on a fixed grid of directions. It
turns support-function deviations into a vector-valued empirical process and
applies a continuous mapping theorem to the gridwise sup-norm statistic. This is
the honest finite-dimensional projection of Beresteanu--Molinari Theorem A.2;
the full continuum Banach-space central limit theorem is deferred. -/

Hausdorff distance, and the direct generalization of `maxAbs` (the `Fin 2` case).

[This follows from taking the measurable pushforward of that Gaussian limit](step:1).

The limit law of the finite-grid support statistic is a probability measure

/-! ## Instantiation on set-valued maps

The shell above is a CLT for an abstract centered process `ψ`.  Here we feed it
the **support process** of a set-valued random variable, giving a finite-grid
CLT for the normalized sum of centered support-function coordinates.  The
separate coordinate bridge below identifies that normalized sum with empirical
Minkowski-average support deviations only under the body-valued hypothesis it
states explicitly. -/

inner-product outcome space](hyp:V), [a set-valued outcome function](hyp:F), [a proposed center

observation to the vector whose coordinate in each direction is the support value of its realized
set minus the support value of the proposed center set.

The **centered support process** of a set-valued random variable `F` on a
finite grid of directions `p : Fin k → V`:
`ψ(x)_j = s(pⱼ, F x) − s(pⱼ, E[F])`, valued in `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin k)`.  The
center `EF` plays the role of the Aumann expectation `E[F]`; the mean-zero
condition `∫ ψ = 0` is exactly the (general-`d`, carried-as-hypothesis) Artstein
identity `s(pⱼ, E[F]) = E[s(pⱼ, F)]`. -/

/-- For a set-valued random variable `F` with center `EF`, observed via an IID sample on a finite
grid of directions `p`, if [the centered support process is measurable](hyp:hψ), [it has finite
second moment](hyp:hvar), [it is mean zero, `E[ψ] = 0`](hyp:hmean), and [the normalized partial
sums of the process are almost-everywhere measurable at every sample size](hyp:hSum_meas), then
[the grid supremum statistic applied to those normalized sums converges in distribution to the
corresponding supremum functional of the process's Gaussian limit](goal).

This is the abstract finite-grid support-process CLT specialized to the support
process generated by `F`, `EF`, and the grid `p`.  It assumes measurability,
mean zero, and measurability of the normalized sums, and concludes
convergence in distribution of `maxAbsK` applied to those normalized sums.  It
does not by itself identify the statistic with empirical Minkowski-average
support deviations; that identification is provided separately by
`supportProcess_normalizedSum_apply` under the body-valued hypothesis. -/
