# Interval random sets and their selection (Aumann) expectation

Tier-0 random-set substrate for partial identification.  The data of an interval
random set is a pair of measurable endpoint functions `L, U : Ω → ℝ` with
`L ω ≤ U ω`, viewed as the set-valued map `ω ↦ [L ω, U ω]`.

The two facts a partial-identification sharpness proof needs are:

* **Measurable selection** — every measurable selection of `[L, U]` is
  `L + t·(U − L)` for a measurable `t : Ω → [0,1]`, and conversely.  For
  interval-valued maps this is elementary (the divide-by-width construction); no
  Kuratowski–Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem is required.
* **Selection (Aumann) expectation** — the set of integrals of integrable
  selections equals `[∫L, ∫U]`.  The `⊇` direction uses a *constant* `t`, so no
  atomlessness / Lyapunov convexity is needed.

Endpoints are reported through `sInf`/`sSup` (matching the
`SandwichInterval` convention) so the eventual support-function generalisation is
a drop-in rather than a rewrite.

## Main results

* `isSelection_iff_exists_param` — selection ↔ `L + t·(U−L)` parametrisation.
* `selectionExpectation_eq_Icc` — selection expectation `= [∫L, ∫U]`.
* `sInf_selectionExpectation` / `sSup_selectionExpectation` — sharp endpoints as
  inf/sup over selections.

Out of scope (flagged for later): the conditional selection expectation
`E[X∣𝒢] = [E[L∣𝒢], E[U∣𝒢]]`, and the support-function / Artstein / CLR-inference
layers.

/-! # Interval Random Sets and Aumann Expectations

This file treats an interval-valued random set as measurable lower and upper
endpoint functions and characterizes its measurable selections. It proves that
the selection, or Aumann, expectation of the interval random set is the interval
whose endpoints are the expectations of the lower and upper endpoint functions.

Main declarations:
* `randomInterval` and `IsSelection` encode interval-valued random sets and
  their measurable selections.
* `isSelection_iff_exists_param` parametrizes every selection as
  `L + t * (U - L)` with measurable `t : Ω -> [0,1]`.
* `selectionExpectation_eq_Icc` identifies the Aumann expectation with
  `[∫ L, ∫ U]`.
* `sInf_selectionExpectation` and `sSup_selectionExpectation` recover the sharp
  lower and upper endpoints from the set of selection integrals.
