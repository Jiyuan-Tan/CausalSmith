# Marginal Sensitivity Model — closed-form bounds for `E[Y(1)]`

The MSM interval endpoints `msmUpper Λ`, `msmLower Λ` (the `sSup`/`sInf` of the candidate IPW mean
over the odds-ratio ambiguity set `MSMSet Λ`, from `Setup.lean`) have a **closed form**. Because
the ambiguity set is the literal Zhao–Small–Bhattacharya odds-ratio box (no calibration constraint),
the optimization over candidate complete propensities is *pointwise separable*: writing the
inverse-propensity weight `w = 1/ẽ`, the candidate mean is `∫ A·Y·w` with `w` ranging pointwise over
`[wMin, wMax]`, where

    wMin(X) = 1 + (1 − e(X)) / (Λ · e(X)),   wMax(X) = 1 + Λ · (1 − e(X)) / e(X),

(`e(X) = propScore true`). The worst case puts `w = wMax` where `Y ≥ 0` and `w = wMin` where `Y < 0`,
giving the closed form

    msmUpper Λ = E[ A · Y · (wMax if Y ≥ 0 else wMin) ],
    msmLower Λ = E[ A · Y · (wMin if Y ≥ 0 else wMax) ].

The proof is the two-sided `sSup`/`sInf` argument: the pointwise box bound shows every candidate mean
is `≤` (resp. `≥`) the closed form, and the boundary weight `w* = (wMax if Y ≥ 0 else wMin)` is
attained by a feasible `ẽ* = 1/w* ∈ MSMSet Λ`, so the closed form is the genuine extremum.

These are valid (and equal to the sup/inf over the ZSB box). They are *not* the sharp Dorn-Guo (2022)
bounds, which additionally impose a weight-calibration constraint that tightens the box into a
conditional-quantile / CVaR balancing functional; the calibrated sharp bounds are developed in the
`Sharp`, `QuantileBalance`, and cutoff-construction modules.

/-! # Closed-form uncalibrated marginal-sensitivity bounds

This file computes the Zhao-Small-Bhattacharya box bounds for `E[Y(1)]`. Because
the uncalibrated odds-ratio ambiguity set is pointwise separable, the supremum
and infimum of the candidate mean are attained by boundary inverse-propensity
weights selected according to the sign of the observed outcome.

The public surface consists of the endpoint weights `wMin` and `wMax`, the
integral forms `msmUpperForm` and `msmLowerForm`, and the closed-form identities
`msmUpper_eq` and `msmLower_eq`.
