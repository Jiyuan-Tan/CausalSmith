for Automated Research in Causal
Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.22511)** — Tan & Syrgkanis,
arXiv:2607.22511. The paper describing this project.

CausalSmith lays foundations for **formalized, machine-checked causal inference**
and builds an **AI theorem pipeline** on top of it. The project is two
[Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/) packages with a one-way dependency — the
`Causalean` library, and the `CausalSmith` package that carries the pipeline and
shares the project's name:

- **`Causalean/`** — the foundational library. Built on
  [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4), it formalizes core
  objects and results of modern causal inference — structural causal models,
  do-calculus, potential outcomes, identification (backdoor, frontdoor, IV, DID,
  LATE, …), partial identification / bounds, panel and design-based inference,
  causal discovery, and semiparametric estimation theory — with full
  machine-checked proofs. Documented in [`doc/API.md`](doc/API.md).
- **`CausalSmith/`** — an umbrella package containing `CausalSmith research`, an
  LLM-driven pipeline that proposes and formally verifies new causal-inference
  theorems on top of Causalean. Causalean never imports CausalSmith.

## Quick start (fresh clone)

Linux, macOS, and Windows are all supported. The commands below are for a POSIX
shell; on Windows run them from **Git Bash** (installed with Git for Windows) and
read the [platform notes](#platform-notes) first.

```sh
# 0. Clone (Windows: see the platform notes for the long-path setting)
git clone https://github.com/Jiyuan-Tan/CausalSmith.git && cd CausalSmith

# 1. Toolchain — elan reads lean-toolchain and installs the pinned Lean version
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh   # Linux/macOS; Windows: elan-init.exe (see below)

# 2. Build the library — both caches make this minutes instead of hours
lake exe cache get               # Mathlib's prebuilt oleans
scripts/fetch_build_cache.sh     # Causalean's prebuilt oleans (a GitHub release asset; needs curl, tar, zstd)
lake build                       # only what changed since the cached commit

# 3. Retrieval tooling — how you actually find things in a ~8000-declaration library
cd CausalSmith/tools && npm install
npm run search -- "backdoor adjustment"
```

Step 2's cache scripts need `zstd` (`apt install zstd`, `brew install zstd`, or the
[zstd releases](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases) on Windows).
Step 3 needs Node ≥ 20.20.2 and is worth doing before you read any Lean source:
the library is large, and `npm run search` is the intended entry point for
locating a definition, lemma, or module. Everything above works offline from a
fresh clone — there are no API keys, no sibling checkouts, and no network
dependencies beyond Mathlib's cache. (Running the theorem-generation pipeline is
the one part that needs model access — see below.)

Then, depending on what you came for:

| You want to… | Start at |
|---|---|
| Find a specific definition or lemma | `npm run search -- "<concept>"` (see below) |
| Orient in an unfamiliar area | `npm run search -- --scope module "<area>"` |
| Browse a module's API | [`doc/API.md`](doc/API.md), section `## <n>. <path>` |
| Contribute a declaration | Write the docstring — see [Documentation](#documentation) |
| Run the theorem-generation pipeline | [`CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md`](CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md) |

### Platform notes

- **Windows — clone.** Every tracked path is kept under 200 characters, so a plain
  `git clone` works from the usual locations (`C:\Users\<you>\...`). A deeply
  nested clone directory or the Lean build tree can still approach Windows'
  260-character limit, so enabling long paths once is recommended:
  `git config --global core.longpaths true` (or `git clone -c core.longpaths=true …`).
- **Windows — shell and tools.** Use Git Bash for the commands above. `curl` and
  `tar` ship with Git for Windows; put `zstd.exe` on `PATH` for the cache scripts.
  Install elan with `elan-init.exe` from the
  [elan releases](https://github.com/leanprover/elan/releases) (or let the VS Code
  Lean 4 extension install it); `lake` then works from Git Bash or PowerShell.
  `.gitattributes` keeps the shell scripts LF whatever `core.autocrlf` is set to.
- **macOS.** Everything works as on Linux; `brew install zstd` for the cache scripts.
  The default file system is case-insensitive, and the repository contains no
  paths that differ only by case.
- **Semantic retrieval** (the optional embedding tier and its Python daemons) is
  Linux/macOS only; the default lexical `npm run search` works everywhere. The
  pipeline's own Windows notes are in
  [`CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md`](CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md#windows).

### Model access for the pipeline

The library and the search tooling need no credentials. The `CausalSmith
research` pipeline does — it drives the `claude` and `codex` CLIs — and you
choose how those calls are paid for:

- **Subscription (default).** Sign the two CLIs in (`claude`, then `codex
  login`) and runs spend those logins. Nothing to configure.
- **API key.** Set `"authMode": "api"` in `CausalSmith/tools/config/local.json`
  (gitignored; copy `local.example.json`) and supply `anthropicApiKey` /
  `openaiApiKey` — inline, or as `anthropicApiKeyFile` / `openaiApiKeyFile`
  paths to files outside the repo. The `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  environment variables override the file.

`anthropicAuth` and `openaiAuth` set the mode per provider, so running the
claude workers on an API key while codex stays on its subscription is a
supported mix. Selecting `api` without a key aborts the run rather than quietly
falling back to a subscription, and each run prints which path it resolved.

## Finding things in the library

Causalean has ~8000 declarations, so grep is usually the wrong tool. The project
ships a ranked retrieval CLI over a docstring-derived index
(`doc/library_index.json`), which is the same engine the CausalSmith pipeline
uses to find reusable lemmas:

```sh
cd CausalSmith/tools

# Concept search (default) — lexical ranking over names, statements, docstrings
npm run search -- "weak overlap minimax rate"

# Type-pattern search, loogle-style
npm run search -- --type "Measure _ → ℝ≥0∞"

# Goal-directed: paste a Lean goal, get lemmas that could close it
npm run search -- --goal "∀ x, f x ≤ g x"

# Module-level orientation: "which file should I read?" rather than "which lemma?"
npm run search -- --scope module "design-based interference"
```

Useful flags: `--k N` (results, default 8), `--cluster panel|exactid|partialid|stat|experimentation|scm`
to restrict the search area, and `--semantic` to add an embedding tier on top of
lexical ranking. The embedding tier requires `npm run embed:library` (Python 3 +
`sentence-transformers`); `--scope module` switches it on automatically whenever
the embeddings are present and fresh, so that mode is slower on first use. The
fine-tuned encoder and reranker behind that tier are gitignored weight
directories: `scripts/fetch_retrieval_models.sh` downloads them (about 2.3 GB,
published as release assets) into `doc/`; without them the tooling falls back to
the off-the-shelf `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` checkpoint.

Each hit shows the score, fully-qualified name, type signature, source file,
whether it is `tier-1` or carries a `⚠usesSorry` flag, and the docstring's
plain-English first paragraph — enough to decide whether to open the file.

If the CLI reports a missing or stale index, regenerate it:

```sh
lake build && lake exe library_index      # from the repository root
```

Two other retrieval surfaces:

- **Library explorer web app** — `CausalSmith/site/` (Astro) renders the same
  index as a browsable `/library` section with natural-language cards for
  headline theorems. `cd CausalSmith/site && npm install && npm run dev`.
- **`lean-lsp-mcp`** — if you work through an MCP-capable editor or agent, it
  gives in-file goal inspection and single-file declaration search, complementing
  the project-wide ranked search above.

## Building

[`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) pins the Lean toolchain (see
[`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain)); with `elan` and `lake` installed the two
packages build independently:

```sh
lake exe cache get          # fetch Mathlib build cache (do this first — it saves hours)
scripts/fetch_build_cache.sh  # fetch Causalean's prebuilt oleans (release asset; lake rebuilds only the delta)
lake build                  # Causalean, the foundational library
lake -d CausalSmith build   # CausalSmith pipeline package (optional; depends on Causalean)
```

A full `lake build` is slow. When iterating, build a single module —
`lake build Causalean.PO.ID.Exact.Frontdoor` — or use `lean-lsp-mcp` for
incremental diagnostics without a build.

A fresh clone builds with no extra setup: the one non-Mathlib dependency,
`FoML` (Rademacher-complexity foundations, consumed by
`Causalean/Stat/Concentration/`, `Causalean/Estimation/`, `Causalean/ML/`), is a
vendored, MIT-licensed adaptation of
[`auto-res/lean-rademacher`](https://github.com/auto-res/lean-rademacher) carried
in-tree under [`third_party/lean-rademacher/`](third_party/lean-rademacher/) (see
its `UPSTREAM.md`). See [`CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md`](CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md) for
the pipeline's additional prerequisites.

## Documentation

- **[`doc/API.md`](doc/API.md)** — per-module API reference (derived from
  declaration docstrings).
- **[`CausalSmith/doc/USER_MANUAL.md`](CausalSmith/doc/USER_MANUAL.md)** — how to
  run the `CausalSmith research` pipeline.
- **[`CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md`](CausalSmith/doc/SETUP.md)** — environment
  prerequisites for the pipeline.

Per-declaration documentation is **docstring-canonical**: each declaration's
plain-English description is authored once, in its Lean docstring, where the
first paragraph is a self-contained natural-language translation of the formal
statement written for a reader with no Lean background. Everything else —
`doc/API.md`'s per-declaration tables, `doc/library_index.json`, the search
embeddings, and the web explorer — is *derived* from those docstrings and
regenerated, never hand-edited.

So to document something, write its docstring; to describe a whole file, write
its `/-! -/` module docstring. After changing declarations or docstrings,
regenerate the derived views:

```sh
lake build && lake exe library_index                 # index (reads the .olean, so build first)
cd CausalSmith/tools && npm run doc:gen              # API.md generated tables
npm run embed:library && npm run lint:embeddings     # semantic search tier (optional)
```

`npm run doc:check` guards `doc/API.md` freshness in CI.
