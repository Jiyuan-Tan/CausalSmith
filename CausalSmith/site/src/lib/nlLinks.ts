/**
 * NL↔Lean crosslinks for a paper's formal blocks — the closed-world (`v3`)
 * artifact.
 *
 * Earlier versions handed the site a phrase of prose and a fragment of Lean and
 * left it to find both again: verbatim substring search, whitespace-normalised
 * run matching, shortest-covering-run selection, and snap policies to keep a
 * wrap from splitting a tag or a formula. Every one of those was a guess about
 * text the pipeline had already parsed, and each guess needed its own guard.
 *
 * `v3` inverts that. The pipeline emits, per block, the structured statement it
 * already built (rows carrying stable ids), the exact byte ranges of the prose
 * segments, and the assignment of rows to segments. The site's job shrinks to:
 * check the offsets are sane, then wrap them. Nothing is searched for, so
 * nothing can be found in the wrong place.
 *
 * What remains here is that validation — offsets in bounds, non-overlapping,
 * and landing neither inside a tag nor inside a formula (a `data-xl` boundary
 * inside a `<span class="math …">` is eaten when KaTeX re-renders it at build
 * time). A block whose offsets fail is dropped whole, with a warning: the paper
 * renders exactly as it would without crosslinks, never with broken HTML.
