/**
 * Reader attestations — the client half.
 *
 * An attestation is one reader saying, of one statement in one paper: "I read
 * this statement and its proof and certify them correct, taking the results the
 * proof invokes as given." It is deliberately MODULAR — nobody is asked to
 * vouch for the whole paper — and it is public: the GitHub handle is shown on
 * the node.
 *
 * Storage is the comments worker (`/api/attestations`), which is also where the
 * GitHub sign-in already lives, so a reader who can comment can attest with no
 * extra ceremony. The write goes THROUGH the worker: the visitor's token is an
 * identity document, not a credential, so the worker authenticates it, resolves
 * the login itself, and keys the record by that. A reader can therefore only
 * ever create or withdraw their OWN mark. Comments now work the same way — this
 * endpoint was the pattern the comment writes were later modelled on.
 *
 * Everything here is DOM-free and network-only, so the controller's logic can
 * be tested against a stubbed `fetch`.
