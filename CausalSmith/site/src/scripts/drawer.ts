      //  • What the pointer actually enters is a CHILD of the carrier (the
      //    `.ds-code` box filling the row), not the annotated element itself.
      //  • Carriers NEST — a `.ds-sub` card and the `.ds-concl` leaf inside it
      //    routinely carry the same token — so the inner one's mouseleave fired
      //    while the pointer was still inside the outer one, which never
      //    re-enters, and the highlight died until you left the row entirely.
      // Resolving the NEAREST annotated ancestor of whatever the pointer is
      // over makes both cases fall out: the innermost carrier wins, and moving
      // between nested carriers is just a recompute.
      // CARRIER INVARIANT: `data-xl` is emitted ONLY on content LINES — a
      // hypothesis row, a side row, an `∃` intro line, a `⊢` leaf, a component
      // head or summary — and never on a card/sub/frame container. Without that
      // rule, a click in a card's padding resolved up to the enclosing card and
