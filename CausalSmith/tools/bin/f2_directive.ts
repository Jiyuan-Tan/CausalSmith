/**
 * Orchestrator-only: inject (or clear) a PERSISTENT scaffold-faithfulness directive for
 * the F2 scaffolder. Sets `state.flags.f2_scaffold_directive`, which `runStage2` reads on
 * every scaffold/revise pass and injects verbatim as a top-priority constraint on top of
 * the .md spec (loop-wide + persistent, mirroring F3's `f3_filler_directive` channel).
 *
 * Use when the F2.5 faithfulness loop keeps escalating a STATEMENT-SHAPE drift the scaffolder
 * re-introduces every pass (an over-assumed premise the note DERIVES; a universal constant
 * quantified after the model parameters; a missing mechanical domain hypothesis; a weakened
 * conclusion). Unlike `scaffold_redirect` — which is one-shot, capped at 2 attempts, review-loop
 * driven, and self-clears — this directive PERSISTS across resumes and steers EVERY F2 pass
 * until you clear it, so a fix cannot be silently reverted by the next re-scaffold.
 *
 * It is a faithfulness/statement-SHAPE steer ONLY — the F2.5 review + anti-laundering + assumption
 * gates still reject any use that INVENTS a hypothesis the spec does not state or WEAKENS a
 * statement. To hand the proof-fill loop a PROOF hint, use `f3_directive.ts`; to change the note
 * itself, rewind (fix-source / redo-math).
 *
 * Clear it once the drift is resolved so it does not bias later unrelated scaffolds.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npx tsx tools/bin/f2_directive.ts <qid> <spec> --directive "<faithfulness constraint>"
 *   npx tsx tools/bin/f2_directive.ts <qid> <spec> --append "<additional constraint>"
 *   npx tsx tools/bin/f2_directive.ts <qid> <spec> --directive -   # read directive from stdin
 *   npx tsx tools/bin/f2_directive.ts <qid> <spec> --clear         # remove the directive
 *   npx tsx tools/bin/f2_directive.ts <qid> <spec> --show          # print the current directive
