 * Run the fixture in a STANDALONE node process: vitest's worker delivers the
 * child `exit` event only once stdio closes (~when the pipe-holder dies), which
 * is exactly the coupling the exit-driven settle routes around, so an in-worker
 * call cannot observe it. Production runs the pipeline as a plain node/tsx
 * process, matching the fixture. Invoked via `node --import tsx/esm` (NOT
 * `npx tsx`, whose IPC-server startup hits `EPERM` on the pipe under a
 * restricted sandbox/CI). The fixture writes its result to a FILE (not stdout)
 * so a piped-stdout flush race can never truncate it.
