// `d0_loop_counters` accumulate across resumes on purpose — re-resuming a non-deterministic
// solver within one attempt is a re-roll, not a retry. A CROSS-PHASE rewind is the other
// thing: F3 refuting a step in Lean, or D0.5 rejecting the angle, is information that did
// not exist when those rounds were spent, and the re-entered D0 re-derives against a
// constraint it has never seen. Carrying the old count in conflated the two, so a run that
// spent a typical 6-9 of the 15 solve rounds re-entered with under half a budget and one
// that spent 12+ tripped `d0_loop_cap_hit` a round or two later — whose only escape resets
// every counter anyway. The leak bought no safety and cost a manual round-trip.
