/**
 * A cap / halt flag that BLOCKS `--resume` until the orchestrator deliberately
 * clears it. This registry is the single source of truth shared by:
 *
 *  - `resolveResumeGates` (pipeline.ts) — reads `flags[flag]`; if truthy it refuses
 *    the resume and surfaces `guidance`.
 *  - the `--clear-gate <flag>` CLI surface (cli.ts) — calls `clear(flags)` as part of
 *    the resume, so the orchestrator NEVER hand-edits `state.json`. Hand-editing risks a
 *    Zod-invalid state that fails the NEXT resume; routing every flag flip through the CLI
 *    keeps the state schema-valid and the action auditable.
 *
 * Each `clear` nulls/undefines the blocking flag AND resets any paired counter (so the
 * cap does not immediately re-trip on the next pass).
