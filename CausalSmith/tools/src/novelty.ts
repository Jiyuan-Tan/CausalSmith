/**
 * Novelty-target vocabulary — UNIFIED with the reviewer publishability-tier ladder.
 *
 * A run's `--novelty` target IS a floor tier: the pipeline accepts a note iff the
 * reviewer-assessed tier meets (>=) the target. The vocabulary is therefore the
 * tier ladder itself: `flagship > field > subfield > incremental`.
 *
 * Historically the CLI used a separate spelling (`relative-to-repo` /
 * `relative-to-literature` / `field` / `flagship`) that mapped onto the tiers via
 * a lookup table. Those two legacy names are still ACCEPTED (old scripts + banked
 * `state.json`) and normalized to the tier vocabulary at every input boundary, but
 * the surfaced/canonical vocabulary is the tier names only.
 *
 * This is a leaf module (no project imports) so `parseArgs` and the state schema
 * can depend on it without pulling in the pipeline dispatcher.
