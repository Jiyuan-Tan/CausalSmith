// Condensed runtime echo of the meta-orchestrator's playbook.
//
// WHY: over a long run the causalsmith skill and its phase sub-skills can
// drift out of the orchestrator's attention, so on resume it can forget what
// to do at the checkpoint it just hit. This module re-surfaces, on every halt, a SHORT
// operative reminder for (1) the checkpoint just reached and (2) the next
// phase — carried in the `next_step_guidance` field of the pipeline.jsonl
// checkpoint line (the line the SKILL tells the orchestrator to read) and
// echoed to the console.
//
// SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH: `.claude/skills/causalsmith/SKILL.md` is the canonical
// entry point; it dispatches `causalsmith-d` / `causalsmith-f` (each with a
// "Per-stage event → action" section) and uses `causalsmith-shared/reference.md`
// for shared procedures. This file holds only the STABLE invariants + a pointer to
// the relevant skill section — keep the pointers matched to the current headings.
// Keep each entry to ~2 sentences: what to do at THIS halt, and what the next
// phase is. Do NOT grow it into a copy of the skill — point, don't paste.
