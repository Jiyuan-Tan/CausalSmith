/**
 * Extract the first valid JSON object from `text`.
 *
 * Walks brace depth (respecting strings + escapes) to find each candidate
 * balanced `{...}` slice, then attempts `JSON.parse` on it. Returns the first
 * slice that parses successfully. This handles three real-world layouts:
 *
 *   (a) Pure JSON output (the common case).
 *   (b) Prose-then-JSON ("Reading the .md confirms…\n{\"route\":...}").
 *   (c) Prose containing accidental balanced braces in code-spans
 *       (e.g. a backticked Lean set ``{Z=z_l}`` or a ``{x | P x}`` builder)
 *       FOLLOWED by the real JSON body. Without try-and-retry, the legacy
 *       extractor latched onto the first balanced pair from the prose and
 *       failed `JSON.parse` at position 1 (unquoted key), masking a perfectly
 *       valid JSON object further down. This was the recurring
 *       "model output did not contain a JSON object" /
 *       "Expected property name or '}' in JSON at position 1" failure.
 *
 * Falls back to a first-`{` / last-`}` slice only if no balanced parse
 * succeeds, which preserves behavior for outputs with stray closing braces.
 *
 * Every candidate slice is parsed through `parseJsonWithEscapeRepair`, so an
 * otherwise-complete payload is never lost to a raw LaTeX backslash — the class
 * that killed a completed D0.5.G verdict at round 60 ("Bad escaped character in
 * JSON at position 1273"). This funnel backs `parseAgentJson`, every D-stage stdout
 * boundary and every F-stage review/intervention payload, so wiring the repair here
 * rather than per call site is what stops the class from resurfacing at whichever
 * boundary next quotes inline math. See that helper for why the repair can make a
 * parse succeed but never succeed DIFFERENTLY.
