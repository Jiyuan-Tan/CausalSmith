/**
 * Single-writer, crash-safe updates for the append-only markdown ledgers
 * (`SUBSTRATE_DEBT.md`, `CITED_DEPENDENCIES.md`).
 *
 * These files are GLOBAL: every qid/spec appends to the same table. The previous
 * read → append-in-memory → `writeFile` sequence held no lock and was not atomic, so two runs
 * recording gates concurrently each wrote a whole file computed from a pre-read snapshot and the
 * last writer erased the other's rows — while both reported success. A crash mid-write could also
 * leave a truncated ledger. Since the ledger is the externally visible record of disclosed
 * substrate debt, a silently dropped row is a disclosure failure, not a cosmetic one.
 *
 * `proper-lockfile` on a sibling marker (PID-aliveness steals locks from
 * dead processes), then temp-file + `rename` so a reader never observes a partial ledger.
