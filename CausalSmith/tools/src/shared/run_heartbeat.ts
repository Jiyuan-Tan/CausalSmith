/**
 * Per-qid run heartbeat for causalsmith pipelines.
 *
 * Replaces the global `findActiveStates` gate in `initializeOrLoadState` with
 * a per-qid concurrency lock. Two `/causalsmith` invocations on distinct qids
 * can run side by side; a second invocation on the same qid is refused.
 *
 * Heartbeat file: `<formalizationDir(qid)>/logs/.run.active`
 *   line 1: `<pid> <specialization> <iso-timestamp> <unique-owner-token>`
 *
 * The actual mutex is `proper-lockfile`'s atomic sibling lock directory; the
 * heartbeat file is owner metadata for operators. This makes stale recovery
 * and simultaneous contenders single-writer safe.
 *
 * `CAUSALSMITH_ALLOW_PARALLEL=1` does not bypass this per-qid lock. Distinct
 * qids already have distinct lock paths and therefore run concurrently; a
 * same-qid bypass would permit two writers to corrupt the shared run state.
 *
 * Legacy migration: a live PID recorded by the former heartbeat-only scheme is
 * still honored even when no sibling lock directory exists.
