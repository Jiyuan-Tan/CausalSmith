/**
 * Write `value` as pretty-printed JSON to `target`, atomically.
 *
 * Every canonical D-stage store is written through this: a torn graph-store object or
 * `core.json` costs the run every proof it holds, and a crash mid-write is not
 * a hypothetical on a shared cluster filesystem. Writing to a sibling temp file and
 * renaming makes the replacement atomic, so a reader sees either the old file or the
 * new one and never a truncated prefix.
 *
 * The temp name carries pid and timestamp so two concurrent writers to the same
 * target cannot collide on the scratch file; `rm` in `finally` leaves no debris
 * behind when the write itself throws.
 *
 * The destination directory is created if absent. `artifactPath` puts that obligation
 * on writers ("Writers must mkdir the dirname"), but nearly every call site here
 * instead relies on an earlier stage having made the subfolder — an invisible ordering
 * dependency that fails with ENOENT exactly when one of these stores is written FIRST
 * into a fresh run tree. Ensuring it here makes the contract hold by construction, and
 * matches every other store writer in the tree (state.ts, log.ts, graph/store.ts).
