// Directive-capture sanitizer, shared by every orchestrator directive CLI
// (`bin/{d0,dneg1,f2,f3}_directive.ts`).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A directive is normally captured from a consult agent's output
// and piped into a directive CLI. When that capture is built wrong — the classic
// being `codex exec --json | jq -r '.msg.text'`, which prints a literal `null` for
// every event that has no `.msg.text` — the resulting text is the agent's private
// reasoning stream interleaved with dozens of `null` lines. The CLIs only refused
// an EMPTY directive, so the garbage was written to the escalation log verbatim and
// re-rendered into every solve prompt of the next round.
//
// Observed cost (stat_pn_weak_event_honest_inference, round 36): a 229-line
// directive of which 44 lines (19%) were the literal string `null`, with the actual
// instruction buried after the noise — re-sent to all 3 solve units.
//
// Policy: literal `null`/`undefined` lines are unambiguous capture artifacts and are
// stripped silently. A capture that is WHOLLY a JSON event stream, or that is mostly
// artifact lines, is refused — at that ratio the surviving prose is very likely
// truncated or interleaved too, and a wrong directive costs a full solve round.
