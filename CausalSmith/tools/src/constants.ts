  // This reverses a 2026-08-08 move to opus, and BOTH replays are real evidence pointing
  // opposite ways — keep both when reading this. On
  // exp_exposure_ambiguity_design_frontier the identical prompt graded `field` on 5/5
  // codex runs and `subfield` on 3/3 opus runs with no within-model variance; the codex
  // critiques NAMED every real defect (exponential saddle, surrogate-not-exact
  // compression, dense-only separation) and then tiered as if none counted. On
  // stat_bdd_uniform_log_penalty (2026-08-09) the same head-to-head ran the other way:
  // opus returned `subfield`/7.0 on three grounds that are each checkably false against
  // the comparator's own text — the estimator class it called "possibly narrower" is
  // CTY's Theorem 6 class verbatim, the "missing" scope qualifier is in the same sentence
  // as the claim, and the framing it called an over-claim says "lower-bound conjecture"
  // and disclaims the matched frontier. Codex returned `field`/7.8, which survives the
  // same check.
  //
  // What distinguishes the two cases is WHERE the verdict rests. Grading a note against
  // PUBLISHED work turns on what a named source actually states, and a referee that
  // cannot open it substitutes plausible guesses that then read as findings. That is an
  // input problem, not a judgment one — so the fix is the web grant (`webSearch: true`,
  // set in runGeneralReview), and the runner follows the model that reasons better once
  // the source is reachable. Revisit on evidence, not on preference; the earlier
  // over-crediting failure is not disproved, only outweighed here.
  //
  // NOTE the known bias direction of this referee class
  // (internal/memory/feedback_topics_gate_over_rejects.md): it over-rejects complete
  // work, and `decideTriageKill` is deliberately narrow because of it — keep it narrow.
  //
  // To revert to opus: set runner "claude" + MODELS.claudeMain, and restore an
  // `unavailableFallback: { runner: "codex", model: MODELS.codexKernel, reasoningEffort:
