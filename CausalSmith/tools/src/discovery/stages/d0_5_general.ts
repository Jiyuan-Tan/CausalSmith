// D0.5.G — the COLD general referee (rubric-free, fresh eyes).
//
// Anti-Goodhart: the rubric became the producer's optimization
// target (and the statement_correction route literally rewrites the headline
// until the rubric is satisfied), so rubric-compliance stopped measuring
// quality. This referee is given ONLY the paper + plain tier definitions — never
// the flagship rubric — so it reproduces the "paste into a fresh model, does it
// actually clear the bar?" check the user does by hand.
//
// Outcome (handled by the caller in stage0_5.ts):
//   tier ≥ floor          → ACCEPT stands.
//   tier < floor, salvageable → ACCEPT downgraded to REVISE; the D0.5 boundary
//                               re-runs runStage0 (re-derive at D0) carrying the
//                               critique + flagged targets.
//   tier < floor, NOT salvageable → ACCEPT downgraded to REJECT + `halt_reason`,
//                               which runReviewBoundary short-circuits to a clean
//                               checkpoint (pipeline halts for the user).
//
// TWO CALL ROLES (see runStage0_5Typed). The AUTHORITATIVE call is the one on the
// round the core panel passes — it decides the accept, exactly as above. A second
// TRIAGE call is dispatched CONCURRENTLY with the panel on the first round of a D0.5
// invocation, so that the non-pass exits (math `fail`, the convergence backstops, D0.R
// self-escalation, cap exhaustion) carry a tier at all: every one of them routes back
// to a D0 re-solve, the priciest step in the pipeline, and used to do so blind to
// whether the note could ever clear the floor. `decideTriageKill` below is the ONLY
// authority a triage read has to end a run early, and it is deliberately narrow.
