// Phase 3 of the 2026-07-30 migration: TeX-out-of-JSON at the D0 solve boundary.
//
// Model-authored LaTeX inside JSON strings kept producing escaping corruption
// (under-escaped `\theta` → control chars; whole-string over-escapes; math-mode
// breaks), and every defense was a heuristic dictionary that grew per incident.
// (Historical note: the retired proof-archive channel never had an
// escaping incident — raw file bytes are never JSON-decoded. This module extends
// that pattern to solver output: the solver writes ONE companion file next to
// its JSON (`solve_<unit>.json` → `solve_<unit>.tex`) containing raw TeX blocks
// delimited by `%%% FIELD <local-ref>` header lines, and the JSON carries
// `{"tex_ref": "<local-ref>"}` in place of the inline string. Ingest slices the
// companion, resolves every ref to its raw bytes (fail-loud on missing or
// duplicate refs), and content-addresses each block into the proof archive.
// From the stores inward the pipeline handles resolved strings exactly as
// today — this migration is about the MODEL boundary, where the corruption
// happens, not the internal stores. Inline strings remain valid indefinitely;
// the normalizer/seal-guard stay as the backstop for them.
//
// Block grammar: a header line matching /^%%% FIELD <ref>$/ starts a block; the
// block's content is every byte after the header line's newline up to (not
// including) the newline that precedes the next header (or EOF). That single
// separating newline is the DELIMITER, not content — so any TeX byte sequence,
// including ones containing lines that merely resemble headers mid-line,
// round-trips byte-identically as long as the solver terminates each block with
// a newline.

 *
 *  Whitespace normalization (the ONLY bytes not preserved, all deliberate and
 *  all TeX-equivalent — they exist to make the downstream JSON-channel repair
 *  heuristics provably unable to fire on companion content, which never passed
 *  through JSON decoding and therefore must never be "repaired"):
 *  - CRLF line endings are accepted and normalized to LF (audit P23F3 — a
 *    Windows worker's companion must not fail ingestion wholesale);
 *  - horizontal tabs become two spaces (audit P23F4 — defuses the
 *    tab-before-letter → `\t…` heuristic);
 *  - a content line starting with the bare sequences `e`/`otin` (then
 *    whitespace, `\`, or `}`/`]`/`,`) gains one leading space (audit R3P23F1 —
 *    defuses the newline-before-`e`/`otin` → `\ne`/`\notin` heuristic; TeX
 *    ignores leading whitespace on a line, so the mathematics is unchanged).
 *
 *  ACCEPTED LIMITATION (audit R4P23F1, minor): the defusal space is
 *  context-blind, and inside a whitespace-PRESERVING environment (`verbatim`)
 *  a leading space is rendered. A D0 proof carrying a verbatim block whose
 *  line starts with a bare `e `/`otin ` trigger would gain one cosmetic space
 *  there; context-aware TeX parsing in the slicer is not worth that case. */
