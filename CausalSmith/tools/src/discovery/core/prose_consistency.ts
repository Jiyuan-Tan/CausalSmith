// interpretation / technical_internal_limitation / honest_scope) are carried over
// STALE. D0-RENDER is a verbatim render (`renderCoreTex`, no reconciliation), so a
// reframe whose directive omits the explicit D0 prose-update channel leaves the prose
// asserting a claim the revised statements no longer deliver (observed 2026-07-10:
// a barrier-led reframe left a stale "matching-bounds / frontier" TL;DR).
//
// Two signals, BOTH ADVISORY (non-blocking): they surface the drift so the D0.R
// prose-sync rule / the D0.5 referee can fix it, rather than letting it render silently.
