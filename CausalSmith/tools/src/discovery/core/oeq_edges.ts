 * question it settles: mapping it to T manufactures a self-cycle and keeping
 * the raw id leaves a dangling edge once Q leaves the render (G4 either way).
 * That edge is replaced by Q's own upstream dependencies, so the answer still
 * reaches the assumptions the question was posed under. Duplicates are removed,
