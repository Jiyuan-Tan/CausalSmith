// One definition of "a core node reference in prose".
//
// There were four divergent copies of this regex, and the divergence was not
// cosmetic — it produced phantom defects that cost real rounds:
//
//   dependencies.ts / stage0_solve.ts   /\b(?:lem|def|ass|thm|prop|conj):[a-z0-9-]+/g
//   stage0_working.ts / core/gate.ts    /\b(?:ass|def|lem|thm|prop|oeq|conj):[a-z0-9-]+/gi
//
// The first pair lacks `oeq` and the `i` flag, so proof prose citing `oeq:foo` or
// `Lem:bar` was never auto-wired into `depends_on`. The second pair DOES match those,
// then compares them against core ids — so the very citation the wiring ignored is
// reported as a DANGLING citation, which drives the auto-heal / halt branch in
// stage0_typed. A formatting difference in prose thereby presented as a structural
// defect in the paper.
//
// NOTE ON `_`: the character class deliberately matches `core/schema.ts`'s id grammar
// (`[a-z0-9-]+`) and does NOT include `_`. Widening it to `[a-z0-9_-]+` looks like a
// robustness win — it stops `lem:foo_bar` truncating to `lem:foo` — but since no legal
// core id can contain `_`, the widened token can never match anything. It can only
// LOSE a reference that previously resolved, and three consumers treat a lost reference
// as a hard signal: `pruneOrphanLemmas` DELETES a lemma whose last inbound prose edge
// disappears, `pruneDeadAssumptions` does the same for assumptions, and
// `findDanglingCitations` reports the ref as dangling and drives the auto-heal/halt
// branch. On an existing core that is a live-node deletion, so: keep the grammar.

// TWO SEMANTICS, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT — see `extractCitationRefs` below.
//
// A node id can appear in prose in two ways, and they mean opposite things:
//
//   lem:foo                      a CITATION — "this core proves lem:foo, I invoke it"
//   other_paper/lem:foo          a MENTION  — "another paper proved lem:foo"
//
// The bare pattern matches both, because `\b` also matches right after `/`. That
// misread cost a run: a comparator node naming its source as
// `stat_cot_observational_efficiency/lem:vanishing-variance-studentization` was
// reported as citing an un-emitted member, the consistency gate invalidated its
// proof, and the theorems depending on it aborted the solve (PIPELINE_NOTES
// 2026-07-18). Naming where an idea came from is not a hole in your proof.
//
// The fix is NOT to narrow the shared pattern: consumers need opposite behaviour.
// `gate.ts`'s aliveness closure and `pruneOrphanLemmas` DELETE a node whose last
// inbound prose edge disappears, so for them a lost reference is a live-node
// deletion — they must keep matching permissively. `findDanglingCitations` HALTS
// the run on a reference it cannot resolve, so for it a spurious reference is a
// phantom defect. Hence: `extractNodeRefs` stays permissive (reachability — never
// loses an edge), `extractCitationRefs` is strict (citations only).

// truncated `def:beta`, which resolves against nothing. That is not a cosmetic misread:
// `findDanglingCitations` halts/auto-heals on an unresolvable ref, so a run reported 24
// dangling citations (`def:holder-class` → `def:holder`, `thm:oracle-high-s` →
