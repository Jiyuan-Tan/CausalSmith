/**
 * Frozen-note immutability guard.
 *
 * Why this exists (2026-06-17): the `.md`/graph NL of a from-note (frozen) node is one of TWO
 * parallel representations of the paper's claim — the other being the `.tex` / paper draft that
 * causalsmith's P3 equivalence gate consumes. F3 (NL↔Lean) consumes the graph NL. If a proof-loop
 * stage MUTATES a frozen NL to make it match the Lean (rather than fixing the Lean), it desyncs the
 * two representations: the `.tex` still states the strong claim, the NL is quietly weakened, and the
 * over-claim slips past F3 while P3 keeps (correctly) flagging it. This actually happened — the
 * legacy F3.5 "delaunder" repair (decision D1) weakened A-1's `cond_exch` from the primitive
 * `(Y(0),Y(1))⊥A∣X` down to the moment-identity bundle it implies, to clear an unused-hypothesis
 * finding. The note is the FROZEN CONTRACT: a stage may edit Lean, never the frozen NL.
 *
 * This guard snapshots every frozen node's NL at loop entry and asserts it is byte-stable across
 * each refresh. A violation is a stage misbehaving (laundering by note-weakening) — surface it
 * loudly rather than letting the weakened note bank.
