/**
 * Node ids needing re-review. Seed = nodes whose fresh hash differs from the
 * recorded passed_hash (or that were never passed). Then propagate to dependents
 * ONLY along `statement-uses` edges: a node's STATEMENT faithfulness depends on the
 * objects its statement references, so a changed statement-dep makes it dirty. It does
 * NOT depend on its PROOF's dependencies — propagating through `proof-uses` would drag
 * every theorem perpetually dirty off its never-reviewed proof lemmas (L-blocks stay
 * `passed_hash:null` since lemmas aren't review targets), defeating the short-circuit.
 * Proof-completeness is tracked separately (proof.state), not via the review dirty frontier.
 *
 * Freshness fallback: a reviewable node with no Lean-extracted hash (a hypothesis-backed node whose
 * Lean realization lives INSIDE a host theorem's signature, not a standalone `@node:`-tagged
 * decl) falls back to the hash of its NL statement — the SAME convention `applyVerdictsToGraph`
 * uses when recording its `passed_hash`. This keeps the comparison symmetric: such a node is
 * verifiable (re-reviewed exactly when its recorded NL spec changes) instead of trusted forever
 * behind a constant sentinel. Its Lean-side drift is still caught via the host theorem's own hash.
