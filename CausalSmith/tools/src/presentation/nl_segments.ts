// Deterministic segmentation of a paper block's inner HTML.
//
// The v2 design let the model quote spans and then checked them character by
// character. That put the model in charge of where a highlight starts and ends,
// so most of the machinery existed to catch it choosing badly: spans that cut a
// tag in half, spans that overlapped each other, spans that were paraphrased
// rather than copied. Here the spans are computed FIRST and the model only
// chooses among them by id — the whole class of defect disappears rather than
// being policed.
//
// Two invariants hold by construction, and are what make that safe:
//   * PARTITION — every byte of the block belongs to exactly one segment, in
//     order, with no gaps and no overlap.
//   * ATOMICITY — no boundary falls inside a tag or inside a math element. A
//     display formula is one whole segment; the text between displays is split
//     only at sentence ends outside inline math.
//   * WELL-NESTED FRAGMENTS — a segment may begin inside an open element (it
//     must: pandoc wraps every sentence and display in `<p>`, so requiring each
//     segment to balance on its own leaves ONE segment per block and no
//     addressable display — measured, not guessed). What is guaranteed instead
//     is the property that actually makes wrapping safe: each segment carries
//     the `openPath` of elements open at its start, it never closes an element
//     it did not have open, and applying its tags to its own path yields the
//     next segment's path. A consumer wraps the text nodes inside the range —
//     which is what a DOM wrap does anyway — and can never emit interleaved
//     tags. `segmentationProblems` checks all of it.
