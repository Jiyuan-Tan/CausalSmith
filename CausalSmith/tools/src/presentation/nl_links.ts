// NL↔Lean crosslinks for the paper's formal blocks — a CLOSED-WORLD assignment.
//
// The site shows each formal block beside its Lean statement, parsed into rows
// (one hypothesis, one conclusion clause each), and highlights the two together
// on hover. This module decides which paper text belongs to which Lean row.
//
// The shape of the decision is what keeps it honest. Both sides are enumerated
// DETERMINISTICALLY before any model call: the Lean statement is parsed into
// identified rows, the paper block into identified segments that tile it exactly
// and never cut a tag or a formula. The model then answers a closed question —
// for every row, which segments state it (or "unstated"); for every displayed
// formula, which declaration realizes it (or "presentation-only") — using ids,
// never quoted text. Totality is schema-enforced, so an unanswered row is a
// failed reply rather than a silent hole; and because the model never authors a
// span, none of the v2 span machinery (verbatim re-checking, overlap
// resolution, provenance arbitration, a repair round, a coverage ledger) has
// anything left to do. Deleting all of it is the point of v3.
//
// Two model calls per bundle-ish: one batched ASSIGN pass over cache-missing
// blocks, one batched VERIFY pass that audits every assignment and every
// "unstated"/"presentation-only" claim, flipping a wrong claim to a demanded
// assignment in the same reply.
