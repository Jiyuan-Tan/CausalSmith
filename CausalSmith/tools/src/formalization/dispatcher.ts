 * TARGETED escalation-log directive (the same channel `bin/d0_directive.ts` uses) and park
 * the cursor at "-0.5" so the next stage is the typed D0-SOLVE. Proto and the working
 * cursor stay intact; only the refuted step's core consumers (and their dependents) are
 * forced open — the promise the redo-math witness block in `vcs/round.ts` already makes to the solver.
 *
 * Two prior shapes of this branch are deliberately gone:
 *  - propose mode used to route through `applyInterventionRoute("stage_0")`, which re-invoked
 *    the D-1.2 PROPOSAL producer and bumped `current_version`; the next D0 assembly then saw
 *    `proposalRevisionChanged`, set `prev = null`, and DISCARDED EVERY CARRIED PROOF to fix
 *    one node — while the escalation watermark (read from the surviving cursor) made the
 *    from-scratch re-solve run with an EMPTY directive context. A witnessed refutation is
 *    not a proposal defect; no statement TEXT changed, so no content check can see it — it
 *    needs the explicit target channel, not a proposal revision.
 *  - non-propose mode moved the cursor WITHOUT appending any escalation entry, so
 *    `hasPendingDirective` was false, the open frontier was empty, nobody was dispatched,
 *    the round passed the discharge gate, and `solve/commit.ts` deleted the witness — the
 *    same lemma was then refuted again, up to REDO_MATH_MAX.
 *
 * ID SPACES ARE DISJOINT AND LOAD-BEARING. `required_core_targets` must name CORE
 * node ids: `vcs/round.ts` refuses to dispatch (the directive stays pending) when a
 * required target is not a graph node, so an unsatisfiable target (e.g. a Lean aux id
 * like `rm.obj_id`) would block every subsequent `--resume` identically. The
 * refuted node itself has no core identity; the core statements whose proofs rest on it are
 * among its graph dependents, so the repair frontier is `[obj_id, ...dependents] ∩
 * core-statement-ids`. When that intersection is empty the rewind cannot be localized, and
 * an UNTARGETED directive would force every statement open (a whole-paper re-derivation) —
 * so we checkpoint for the orchestrator instead of auto-rewinding.
