/*!
 * Curated alias lexicon for the (closed, small) causal-inference / econometrics
 * vocabulary. It exists to bridge the vocabulary-mismatch failure of pure keyword
 * retrieval: an F1 plan may say "ignorability" while the Causalean declaration is
 * named `ConditionalExchangeability` — zero shared tokens, so keyword match alone
 * never surfaces it. Each entry maps a canonical concept to its synonyms and to the
 * Causalean module/area prefixes where that concept's declarations live.
 *
 * Two consumers (see reuse_retrieval.ts):
 *   1. Query expansion — before scoring, a query's terms are widened with the
 *      synonyms of every matched concept, so "ignorability" also matches on
 *      "exchangeability" / "unconfoundedness".
 *   2. Module-level fallback — when no indexed declaration scores, the matched
 *      concepts' `modules` point the agent at the right area to search by hand.
 *
 * Maintenance: this is meant to GROW from friction logs. Every time a run
 * re-derives a Causalean declaration because the words differed, add the missing
 * synonym here. Keep it high-precision (genuine synonyms only) — a loose alias
 * floods every query with false candidates.
