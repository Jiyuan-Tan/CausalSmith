/**
 * F4 dead-helper sweep — agent-authored declarations nothing in the run consumes.
 *
 * Every gate before F4 checks that proofs are CORRECT (build green, no sorry, axioms); nothing
 * checks that a declaration is USED. Helper lemmas are authored ahead of a planned proof route,
 * the route changes, and the abandoned helper still compiles — so it survives to F5, gets a
 * docstring, fossilizes into the bank, and P1 renders it into a paper where no proof cites it
 * (observed live: `cellApproxPolynomial_coeff_envelope`, discrete-ATE Lemma 10). The bank graph
 * cannot detect this: its `proof-uses`/`ref_set` edges record what the DISCOVERY-stage derivation
 * planned, not what the final Lean realizes — over- and under-declared in the same run. This
 * sweep therefore reads the ground truth: the Lean sources at the done-point, when usage is final.
 *
 * A finding is a FLAG for the orchestrator, never an auto-delete: a follow-on run may consume an
 * earlier run's helpers (substrate reuse), so "unused by this run" is grounds for adjudication —
 * prune, or keep with a recorded reason.
 *
 * Scope guards against false positives: only public, attribute-free `theorem`/`lemma`/`def`s are
 * candidates (an `@[simp]`-style attribute or `instance` is consumed implicitly, with no textual
 * call site), and declarations realizing a graph node are exempt (results are products — they are
 * ALLOWED to have no consumer). Usage is a whole-identifier textual match over comment/string-
 * masked sources; same-name declarations in different namespaces merge, which can only
 * under-report (the safe direction).
 *
 * Deliberate keeps: a decl whose preceding lines carry a `-- keep: <reason>` comment is exempt —
 * the justification lives in the source next to what it justifies, and the sweep stays quiet on
 * re-entry. An empty reason does not count.
