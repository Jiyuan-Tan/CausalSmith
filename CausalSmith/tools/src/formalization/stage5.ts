 * edits Lean past here, so the lemma set is final and line numbers are accurate.

 * NO LONGER best-effort. A silently-swallowed emit failure left the PREVIOUS
 * (pre-de-laundering) table banked as if current — the bug behind P-8 shipping
 * `lean: null` with a stale `equivalent` verdict. On emit failure, or a
 * self-consistency contradiction (a row claiming a verified match with no anchor),
 * return a block reason so F5 refuses to reach CKPT 2 with a stale/inconsistent
 * table. Returns `null` on success.
