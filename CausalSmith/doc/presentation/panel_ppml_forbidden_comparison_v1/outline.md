# Sections

## section: Abstract
The abstract will be drafted after the body. It will state the multiplicative staggered-adoption setting, the population sign-reversal result for the pooled fixed-effect PPML coefficient, the explicit four-cohort witness, and the contrast with the positive counterfactual-share proportional target.

## section: Introduction
The introduction will motivate the problem from staggered-adoption DiD with multiplicative means, explain why a single fixed-effect PPML population coefficient can be a poor causal summary under heterogeneous proportional effects, and preview the derivative sign characterization, the explicit positive-effect sign reversal, and the primitive sign index. One factual sentence will point readers to the appendix verification note for the machine-checked deterministic population scope.

## section: Related Literature
This section will position the paper within program-evaluation DiD, heterogeneous-effect staggered adoption, nonlinear and semiparametric DiD, misspecified pseudo-likelihood, fixed-effect Poisson estimation, PPML gravity practice, and proportional-effect PPML DiD. It will emphasize that the paper studies the population pseudo-true coefficient of a misspecified pooled PPML regression, not sampling inference for the estimator.

## section: Setup and Assumptions
This section will introduce the triangular-array panel, cohort-time collapse, untreated exponential mean restriction, proportional treatment effects, rank condition, and the deterministic population PPML projections. The sample coefficient will be defined only to connect notation to the empirical regression, with the text making clear that the paper’s formal claims concern population projections rather than sampling consistency; the section will also define the weighted FWL residual, the sign-reversal region, the explicit four-cohort witness, and the elimination handle used later for the primitive sign characterization.

## section: Main Results
This section will present the sharp derivative formula for the pseudo-true PPML coefficient, the forbidden-comparison sign rule through the weighted FWL residual, the homogeneous-effect benchmark, the primitive sign characterization, and the explicit four-cohort sign-reversal witness as a consequence of that characterization. It will distinguish the unsafe pooled coefficient from the positive counterfactual-share proportional target.

## section: Discussion and Extensions
This section will interpret the results for empirical PPML DiD practice, especially in settings where multiplicative gravity-style specifications and staggered treatment timing are natural. It will discuss why the primitive sign index is a diagnostic for the pooled coefficient rather than a correction, and why granular proportional effects and their counterfactual-share average remain the relevant causal summaries under the maintained mean restrictions.

## section: Appendix: Proofs, Auxiliary Lemmas, and Verification Note
The appendix will collect the unit-FE collapse result, the pseudo-true projection first-order condition, and the proofs of the main results in an order that proves the primitive sign characterization before using it for the four-cohort sign-reversal result. It will end with a concise verification note stating that the displayed assumptions, definitions, lemmas, and theorems are machine-checked at the deterministic population and collapsed finite-dimensional levels, while sampling consistency, inference, and external economic identifying assumptions enter only as stated inputs.
