# Title

**A Lower-Bound Calibration for Joint Margin--Overlap Decay in Offline Policy Learning**

**Contribution statement.** The paper gives a minimax lower-bound calibration for welfare regret under joint margin-overlap decay, and a conditional analysis of a specified clipped cross-fitted AIPW empirical welfare rule with supplied nuisance estimates under explicit high-level side conditions.

# Notation

env_overrides: prop:overlap-envelope=propositionv

notation_gaps: $p_P(x)$=the frozen layer uses the overlap score but no definition environment states whether it is $\min\{e_P(x),1-e_P(x)\}$ or another endpoint distance; $\mathcal P_{\alpha,\gamma}$=the law class is named by `def:law-class` but its displayed set notation is not fixed there; $\eta$=the nuisance triple is used by `def:clipped-propensity` and `def:clipped-aipw-score` but only informally identified as $(\mu_0,\mu_1,e)$; $\widehat\eta^{(-k)}$=cross-fitted nuisance estimators are used in `def:feasible-erm` but their construction is not defined; $Y(a)$=potential outcomes appear in assumptions but no frozen definition introduces the potential-outcome space.

# Sections

## section: Abstract

The abstract will be drafted after the body is fixed. It should state the observed-law offline policy-learning problem, the one-sided overlap-decay condition near the treatment propensity boundary, the minimax lower exponent, and the conditional clipped-AIPW upper exponent without claiming a full matching feasible characterization where the frozen layer leaves `oeq:feasible-tight` open.

## section: Introduction

The introduction motivates welfare regret in observational policy learning, explains why near-violations of overlap alter regret rates under margin structure, and previews the lower-bound calibration and the conditional feasible upper bound. It includes one factual sentence directing readers to the final verification note for the machine-checked scope.

## section: Related Literature

This section positions the paper relative to treatment-choice and welfare-regret methods, semiparametric and doubly robust estimation, margin-based excess-risk theory, and econometric work on limited overlap and off-policy learning. It should not describe the open feasible-tightness question as a result.

## section: Setup and Assumptions

This section introduces the observed-law experiment, the welfare-regret target, the policy class, the margin and overlap-decay restrictions, and the law class used for the minimax analysis. It also introduces the notation whose home is the setup prose, including $P$, $O=(X,A,Y)$, $P_X$, $e_P$, $\mu_a$, and the observation space, before any formal statement uses them.

## section: Minimax Lower Bound

This section presents the overlap-margin calibration, the two-point construction, the product-divergence control, the regret separation, and the resulting minimax lower bound. The section should emphasize that the lower bound is an observed-law statement over `def:law-class` and that the two policies used in the reduction must be available in the policy class as stated in the witness-membership lemma.

## section: Conditional Analysis of a Clipped Cross-Fitted AIPW Rule

This section defines the clipped score, the cross-fitted empirical welfare rule, the feasible tuning schedule, and the conditional risk object. It then states the conditional achievability result for the plain clipped cross-fitted AIPW ERM under the exact nuisance, cross-fitting, and empirical-process side conditions bundled into the frozen environments.

## section: Discussion and Open Question

This section interprets the gap between the minimax lower exponent and the conditional feasible exponent when the nuisance regime is limiting. It records `oeq:feasible-tight` only as an explicitly open question about whether genuinely feasible procedures can attain the converse exponent in the strict-gap branch.

## section: Appendix A. Algebra, Testing, and Witness-Law Details

This appendix contains proof details for the overlap-envelope calculation, witness membership, two-point divergence, regret separation, and the in-core Le Cam testing reduction. It should preserve the frozen statements and use the appendix prose only to connect their proof steps.

## section: Appendix B. Empirical-Process and Cross-Fitting Details

This appendix contains the cross-fit offset control and the self-bounding argument used by the feasible upper bound. The role of fixed $K$, balanced folds, and the assumed empirical-process envelopes should be stated as inputs rather than consequences of the law class.

## section: Appendix C. Clipped-Score Drift and Bias Localization

This appendix gives the clipped-score drift identity and the localization steps used to control the deterministic bias from clipping and nuisance estimation. It should flag that the exact drift identity rules out any stronger cancellation claim under the frozen assumptions alone.

## section: Appendix D. Verification Note

This final appendix consolidates the Lean machine-checking scope: the observed-law objects, exponent definitions, witness construction, lower-bound skeleton, clipped-score identities, ERM inequality, and conditional upper-bound dependencies are the verified formal layer, while nuisance-rate conditions, fixed-fold cross-fitting, VC localized envelopes, and offset-envelope controls enter as explicit assumptions. It should also note that potential-outcome interpretation is non-load-bearing for the formal observed-law regret statements.
