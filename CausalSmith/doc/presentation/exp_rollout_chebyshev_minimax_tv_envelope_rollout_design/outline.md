# Title
**Chebyshev Rollout Schedules for Polynomial Extrapolation under Low-Order Interference**

**Contribution statement.** The paper derives the minimax treated-fraction schedule, under a sharp total-variation variance envelope, for estimating a polynomial rollout contrast in finite-population monotone Bernoulli designs, and shows that shifted Chebyshev-Lobatto schedules attain the low-budget exponential rate.

# Sections
## section: Abstract
This section will be drafted after the body is fixed. It will state the finite-population rollout problem, the polynomial low-order restriction, the minimax schedule result under the variance envelope, and the Chebyshev low-budget rate without introducing formal inventory or proof details.

objs: none

bib: none

## section: Introduction
This section motivates treated-fraction placement in staggered rollout experiments with interference, relates the problem to potential outcomes, exposure-based randomization inference, low-order network interference, and optimal design, and states the main contribution at a high level. It includes only one factual sentence saying that the appendix records the machine-verified formal scope.

## section: Setup and Assumptions
This section introduces the finite-population monotone Bernoulli rollout design, the schedule and law classes, the polynomial rollout restriction, the variance envelope, the unbiased linear weights, the Chebyshev schedule, the amplification criterion, and the exact nested-risk benchmark. It also introduces ordinary notation used by later frozen statements, including $\Omega,\pi,\mathbb E_\pi,\operatorname{Var}_\pi,\operatorname{Cov}_\pi,n,U_n,\hat\tau_{w,p}$, and $p^{\mathrm{eq}}(\beta,q)$.

## section: Main Results
This section presents the polynomial identity, the total-variation envelope design theorem, the equal-spacing benchmark, the full-budget boundary observation, and the Chebyshev minimax theorem. The section emphasizes the econometric interpretation: the design variable is the treated-fraction schedule, and Chebyshev-Lobatto placement controls the worst-case amplification exponent in the low-budget regime.

## section: Discussion and Extensions
This section discusses how the envelope result relates to the exact finite-population nested-rollout covariance problem, reports the exact-risk rate-feasibility implication, and labels exact Chebyshev optimality for the true covariance matrix as an open question rather than a proved property. It also situates possible extensions to clustered and mixed rollout designs without making them part of the contribution.

## section: Appendix: Proofs and Verification
This section contains the proof architecture and auxiliary approximation and variance lemmas: the $\ell^1/\ell^\infty$ dual norm, Chebyshev exterior extremality, oversampled Lobatto norming, the continuous endpoint bound, Chebyshev schedule admissibility, nonemptiness of unbiased weights, and variance-envelope sharpness. It ends with a verification note consolidating the Lean machine-checking scope: the finite-design variance algebra and real-polynomial approximation objects are verified, while the potential-outcome consistency, polynomial rollout class, and round-mean variance envelope enter as assumptions.
