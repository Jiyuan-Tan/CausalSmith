## section: Setup and assumptions

This section defines the finite-population bipartite experiment, feasible heterogeneous Bernoulli designs, exposure-weighted Hájek estimator, variance objects, and graph-only optimization criteria, then states the regularity conditions for large-sample inference. It opens with one diagram displaying the bipartite graph and its induced outcome-overlap graph, uses the notation table to distinguish $s_k$, $d_i$, $S_{ij}(G_n)$, and $\Delta_n$, and introduces the directional-modulus notation and its feasible-domain interpretation before the main-results display that uses it.

## section: Main results

This section presents the heterogeneous overlap variance representation, the convex graph-envelope design problem and KKT characterization, asymptotic normality, design-stage conservative Wald coverage based on a deterministic variance-scale bound, strict separation from homogeneous assignment, and positive and negative results for the surrogate certificate. Immediately before the heterogeneity-separation theorem, it displays the directional-modulus formula, its feasible-domain supremum, and the positivity-domain basis for finite application-specific bounds.

## section: Discussion and extensions

This section interprets the graph-only design criterion relative to clustering and outcome-model-based approaches, including the implications of the bounded-degree certificate and the immediately preceding disproved first-order dispersion conjecture. It identifies extensions without treating them as delivered results.

## section: Appendix with proofs and auxiliary lemmas

This appendix supplies detailed proofs and auxiliary probability arguments, including the bounded-degree dependency-graph CLT; the main text retains only proof sketches where they convey design intuition. It ends with a verification note consolidating the Lean machine-checking scope for the finite-design and Bernoulli-randomization components, while identifying the bipartite graph scaffolding and stated asymptotic regularity conditions as inputs to the formal development.
