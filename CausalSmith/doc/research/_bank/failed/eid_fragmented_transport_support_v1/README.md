proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a fresh ExactID topic on support-fragmented causal transport across multiple source trials. The reviewer found a genuine practical issue but not a flagship gap: the proposed atom-cover certificate is close to existing multi-trial transport overlap results, especially Dahabreh et al. 2023, and the failed-certificate interval collapses to classical bounded-outcome missing-cell bounds. This was stopped early after one review by design; the failure is topic choice, not pipeline behavior or reviewer over-strictness.

# eid_fragmented_transport_support / v1 â€” Failed

**Topic.** Flagship new topic: support-fragmented causal transport across multiple source trials. Characterize sharp identification of a target-population ATE when no single source trial satisfies positivity on the target covariate support, but the collection of source trials jointly covers the target. The proposed kernel is a finite-support Hall-type if-and-only-if certificate: target ATE is identified exactly when every target support atom can be assigned to a source trial with experimental treatment support and invariant conditional potential-outcome law; below the certificate give a sharp partial-ID interval and explicit two-source witness. This should be positioned against Pearl-Bareinboim multi-transportability and Dahabreh-style multiple-trial transport as a finite positivity/support-fragmentation frontier, not an upgrade of any banked topic.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REVISE

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after Stage -0.5 angle0 v1 REVISE at field tier: Dahabreh et al. 2023 already treats fragmented trial support under weaker collection-level overlap, and the proposed below-frontier interval reduces to classical Manski/Robins bounded-outcome missing-cell bounds.
