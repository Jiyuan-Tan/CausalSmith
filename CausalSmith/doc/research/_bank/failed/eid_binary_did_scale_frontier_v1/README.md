  - "angle0_v1: Theorem 1 was flagged C-definitional-unfold: solve OREC, define Delta_OR-add=q_L-q_A, and factor q_L=q_A."
  - "angle0_v1: Conjecture 1 promised an open-cell finite SWIG witness family but only set conditional means p11=q_A or p11=q_L, not a full finite observed/latent law."
  - "angle0_v1: Conjecture 2's scale-link exhibit was false as written; the proposed probit value on the symmetric branch did not separate from q_A."
  - "angle0_v2: still field-tier under flagship target. Reviewer called Theorem 1 a direct finite-table algebraic corollary of OREC/UDiD and said flagship would require an observable test statistic, asymptotic distribution, or decision rule."
  - "angle0_v2: Conjecture 2 remained under-anchored against Roth-Sant'Anna functional-form sensitivity and Wooldridge nonlinear DiD."

proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted to turn binary additive DiD versus OREC/UDiD into a flagship finite-table equality frontier with Delta_OR-add and non-nesting witnesses. The reviewer accepted that the repo axis was clear, but twice kept the proposal at field tier because the main theorem was routine logit/OREC algebra and the witness/scale-invariance claims lacked a full finite law or close comparator anchors. Do not revive this as another equality-frontier proposal unless the core object becomes a named estimator or inference geometry with a decision rule beyond definition unfolding.

# eid_binary_did_scale_frontier / v1 - Failed

**Topic.** Additive parallel-trends DiD versus odds-ratio equi-confounding DiD for binary outcomes, targeting a finite observed table frontier between additive risk transport, OREC/UDiD logit transport, and corrected scale transport.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REVISE / field at angle0 v1 and angle0 v2.

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped at D-0.5 after angle0 v2 remained field-tier under the flagship target. The main theorem was still routine Delta_OR-add=q_L-q_A algebra, and the reviewer said a flagship upgrade would require a named estimator/frontier package with an observable statistic, asymptotic distribution, or decision rule rather than another equality-frontier revision.

## Reflection

Failure cause: topic/proposal strength, not reviewer strictness or D0 solver weakness. The proposal did repair some coherence issues between v1 and v2, but the remaining mathematical core was a finite-table algebraic corollary of OREC/UDiD rather than a nonroutine flagship object. Future binary-DiD topics should start from estimator geometry, inference, or a full finite-law witness class; do not spend more attempts on Delta_OR-add equality-frontier variants alone.
