proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted to turn multivariate interval regression with coordinatewise monotonicity into a sharp antichain/frontier certificate theorem plus a finite nonrectangular witness. The review found the core pruning step mathematically unjustified: interval validity and monotonicity do not imply that non-frontier endpoint cells can be discarded, and the one-dimensional reduction was already Manski-Tamer. Reuse the literature map and the negative diagnosis, but do not revive this kernel without an explicit endpoint-cell dominance condition or a fully specified witness.

# pid_multivariate_interval_regression / v1 â€” Failed

**Topic.** New topic: sharp identified regions for interval regression with several interval-measured regressors under coordinatewise or selected-coordinate monotonicity. Pre-anchor check: closest published anchor is Manski-Tamer interval regression for one interval-measured scalar regressor, with later set-inference work for the resulting identified set. Our theorem is not that because multi-coordinate interval regressors create a partial order: worst-case completions are governed by antichain/frontier geometry rather than the one-dimensional lower/upper endpoint ordering. Require a concrete nonroutine object: an antichain certificate or minimal frontier basis for sharp lower and upper regression-function envelopes, plus a finite two-regressor witness where coordinatewise monotonicity yields a nonrectangular identified region that cannot be recovered by intersecting one-dimensional Manski-Tamer bounds. If the proposal reduces to generic LP duality, ordinary interval arithmetic, or a definition-unfold frontier, pivot or stop early.

**Novelty target.** relative-to-literature

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped after first D-0.5 hard REJECT: antichain/frontier kernel was mathematically invalid as stated (frontier pruning not justified by interval validity/monotonicity), scalar collapse was already Manski-Tamer, and the nonrectangular witness was only promissory.
