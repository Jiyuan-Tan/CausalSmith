proof_attempt_summary: |
  The proposal attempted a flagship-tier sharp Pi-loaded leakage-null frontier theorem separating canonical Bartik SSIV, Borusyak-Hull recentered IV, and design-based formula IV moments, framed as a new necessary-and-sufficient characterization. Across three angles and three reviewer rounds, every incarnation of the headline kernel (Theorem 1 + Conjecture 1) was ruled already-known: the 'Pi-null frontier' is merely a linear-share restatement of the recentered formula-instrument validity condition already stated as an iff boundary in BorusyakHull2023Econometrica and BorusyakHullJaravel2025ECTJ. Recurring soundness defects — Omega=0 conflated with uncorrelated shocks, scalar/vector projection mismatch in beta_R-beta_D, missing residual shock-loading term — were not corrected across angle pivots, and the pivot budget was exhausted with all three angles at REJECT/not-publishable.

# eid_shift_share_design / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp non-equivalence/strict-extension theorem between three leading shift-share / formula IV estimators: the canonical Bartik-style shift-share IV (Borusyak, Hull, Jaravel 2022, Review of Economic Studies) used with shock-level identifying variation, the recentered-instrument variant (Borusyak and Hull 2023, Econometrica) that subtracts the expected exposure-weighted shock under randomized counterfactual shock realizations, and the formula-IV / design-based variant (Borusyak 2025, Econometrics Journal) that relaxes the shock-exogeneity moment to a covariate-conditional design-based moment. All three target the structural exposure coefficient beta_exp on the same DGP under shock independence + exposure additivity. The flagship question (axis b: non-equivalence frontier between named published shift-share estimators): characterize the sharp boundary in shock-correlation/dependency space at which the three estimators have asymptotically equivalent identifying moments vs. strictly different limit functionals, as a function of (i) the shock cross-correlation matrix Omega, (ii) the exposure-share covariance Pi, and (iii) the covariate-conditional shock-mean leakage rate epsilon. The kernel claim is a closed-form spectral non-equivalence theorem: the Bartik IF, the recentered-IV IF, and the Borusyak design-IF identify the same structural beta_exp if and only if a spectral condition lambda_max(Omega Pi) <= lambda_star holds, where lambda_star is a sharp threshold equal to the smallest singular value of an explicit observable kernel built from Pi and the design-leakage rate epsilon; when lambda_max(Omega Pi) > lambda_star, the Bartik estimator is biased proportional to the shock-correlation excess while the recentered-IV remains consistent and the design-IV achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. lambda_star is a NEW mathematical object computable from observable shock cross-moments + exposure-share covariance + design-leakage rate, NOT an existence/absence statement from prior work. Recovers the classical Bartik consistency under uncorrelated shocks (lambda_max(Omega Pi)=0) and provides the first sharp triple-non-equivalence boundary for shift-share / formula IV in closed form.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**D-0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**D0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** D-0.5 NO-PASS — all 3 angles REJECT@not-publishable on v1 (immediate, no revise cycle). Recurring C-wellposed defects across pivots: Omega definition normalization wrong (Omega=0 ≠ uncorrelated shocks; uncorrelated normalized shocks yield diagonal not zero), scalar/vector projection mismatch (beta_R-beta_D claimed scalar but defined via vector projection), missing residual shock-loading term needed for beta-equality determination. Proposer didn't adjust across angle pivots. Reviewer also flagged missing Borusyak-Hull 2025 NBER w33594 as a closer comparator. Failure is proposer-side proposal-quality, not rubric incompatibility. Math kernel could be revised, but pivot budget exhausted.
