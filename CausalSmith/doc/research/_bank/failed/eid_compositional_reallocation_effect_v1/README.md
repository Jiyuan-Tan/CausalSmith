proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a fresh ExactID topic on causal effects of compositional treatments on a simplex, focusing on when an effect of increasing one component is invariant to the reallocation rule over the other components. The repo gap was clear and the topic is intellectually clean, but three D-0.5 reviews stayed at field tier: the main result kept reducing to constrained-gradient/support-span geometry already foreshadowed by compositional-data and mixture-experiment literature. This is a topic-strength failure rather than a pipeline failure; a future attempt would need to be a real inference/EIF paper or a nonroutine support-boundary theorem, not another identification iff.

# eid_compositional_reallocation_effect / v1 â€” Failed

**Topic.** Flagship new topic: causal identification for compositional treatments on a simplex. Characterize when a reported 'effect of increasing component j' is a well-defined causal estimand: because treatment shares sum to one, every component increase requires a substitution rule over the remaining components. The proposed kernel is an exact reallocation-invariance theorem: a component-effect functional is nonparametrically identified from observational or randomized mixture data if and only if all admissible substitution paths have the same path derivative of the dose-response surface; otherwise only path-specific reallocation effects are identified. Include a finite three-component witness where two substitution paths have opposite signed component effects despite the same observed mixture-response law, plus a sharp simplex-gradient condition recovering standard continuous-treatment dose-response as the unconstrained limit. Position against continuous-treatment causal dose-response and compositional-data regression, not as an upgrade of any banked topic.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NONFLAGSHIP-KILL

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after Stage -0.5 angle0 v3 still REVISE at field tier: the compositional-treatment topic has a clear repo gap, but the proposed identification kernel remains elementary support-span/gradient geometry; other Stage -1.1 angles appeared field-tier unless converted into an estimator/inference paper.
