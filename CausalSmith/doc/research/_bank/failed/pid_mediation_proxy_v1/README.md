proof_attempt_summary: |
  The proposal attempted to prove that rank-deficient negative-control proxies yield a sharp non-rectangular joint identified set for (PNDE, TNIE) as a line segment parameterized by a shared bridge-null coordinate. Across three angles and ten revision cycles the flagship sharpness conjecture (E(P)=[ell,u]) was refuted in-derivation: what survived was only the definitional projection identity Theta_I(P)=f(E(P)) (thm:outer-sharp) plus elementary two-point affine-slope bookkeeping (thm:total-effect), both rated tier=incremental/subfield. No angle delivered a field-level new observable criterion, sharp LP construction, or non-trivial impossibility theorem, and the pivot budget was exhausted with no re-derivable kernel remaining.

# pid_mediation_proxy / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of natural direct and indirect effects in mediation with unobserved post-treatment confounders, using negative-control proxies for the latent mediator-outcome confounder and a single binary treatment

**Novelty target.** field

**D-0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**D0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Banking reason.** D-0.5 ACCEPT angle 2 v5 tier=field; D0.5 REJECT (novelty, case 6b) — kernel collapsed to definitional projection identity Theta_I(P)=f(E(P)); pivot budget exhausted across angles 0/1/2.
