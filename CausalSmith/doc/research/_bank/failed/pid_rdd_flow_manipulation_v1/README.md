proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a computation-axis flagship upgrade of the bounded-manipulation RDD parent: many-neighborhood sharp endpoints via flow/TU machinery and an explicit dual certificate. The topic was better targeted than the network-IV run, and the reviewer accepted the broad literature gap, but the proposed algorithm never became fully constructive: retained-mass search, global endpoint envelope, graph balances, and the worked dual certificate remained under-specified or inconsistent. Treat this as a proposal-math failure; a future attempt should hand-derive the finite graph convention and one complete global-envelope example before invoking thmsmith.

# pid_rdd_flow_manipulation / v1 â€” Failed

**Topic.** Flagship computational upgrade of the banked bounded-manipulation RDD partial-ID result: replace the closed-form single-cutoff envelope by a strongly-polynomial min-cost-flow / total-unimodularity algorithm for sharp covariate-conditional manipulation bounds across many cutoff neighborhoods, with an explicit dual certificate recovering the parent interval as the one-cutoff case.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -0.5 NO-PASS after 5 angles: RDD min-cost-flow computation upgrade had plausible literature gap but failed proposal review because finite endpoint search, retained-mass candidates, and active-budget dual certificate remained under-specified.

**Supersedes.** pid_rdd_manipulation_bounded_v1 (tier=candidates, upgrade_axis=computation). The parent now lives in `_bank/downgraded/` (the `candidates` tier was retired 2026-07-18 and the parent re-graded subfield) and remains an independent reference; this entry is the flagship upgrade.
