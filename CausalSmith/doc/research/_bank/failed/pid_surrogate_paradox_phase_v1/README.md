proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a flagship binary principal-surrogate paradox phase theorem with a responder-stratum threshold and endpoint-attaining finite witnesses. The best angle reduced to identified-interval endpoint signs or bounded-mixture algebra, while later pivots either failed finite-table sanity checks or mischaracterized ACS/CEP comparators. Future work should not revive this as a flagship run unless it starts from a verified ACS/CEP or Yin-Liu-Geng-Luo comparator frontier with a hand-derived nonroutine witness/certificate.

# pid_surrogate_paradox_phase / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Principal surrogate paradox phase threshold. Pre-anchor check: closest anchors are Frangakis-Rubin principal stratification and surrogate-paradox results such as Chen-Geng-style causal necessity/sufficiency criteria. Why non-trivial? The target is not another Manski principal-strata LP bound: require a finite binary principal-strata witness class with an explicit sign-reversal threshold where the treatment effect on the surrogate is positive in every observable arm but the principal-stratum effect on the outcome flips sign. Why promising? The nonroutine object is a hand-checkable phase threshold plus endpoint-attaining witness family. If the delta reduces to missing-cell bounds, LP duality, or definition-unfold surrogate criteria, pivot or accept field-tier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after repeated D-0.5 failures: angle 0 stayed field-tier after three revisions, angles 1 and 2 were not-publishable, and angle 3 stayed field-tier then rejected; the surrogate-paradox phase topic collapsed into routine/broken finite-table algebra rather than a flagship object.

## Key files

- `pid_surrogate_paradox_phase_v1_state.json` — pipeline state at banking (`banked: true`).
- `pid_surrogate_paradox_phase_v1_proposal.tex` — final proposal version.
- `pid_surrogate_paradox_phase_v1.tex` — derivation note (if Stage 0 ran).
- `pid_surrogate_paradox_phase_v1_reviews.jsonl` — per-round reviewer log (Stage -0.5 and Stage 0.5).
- `reviews/` — per-version reviewer JSON files (if present).

## Notes

Reflection: this was a topic/proposal-strength failure. The literature map found real adjacent surrogate-paradox material, but every attempted kernel stayed below the flagship bar or became mathematically incoherent. No pipeline bug was observed after launch; the run was manually stopped after repeated D-0.5 failures and then banked with `bank_entry.ts`.
