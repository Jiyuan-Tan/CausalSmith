proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a nonregular inference topic for endpoints formed by intersections over rich covariate level sets. Two independently reviewed angles failed hard at D-0.5: the contact-cone/phase-threshold angle was already CLR active-set supremum inference, and the two-point bootstrap-failure angle was a routine Fang-Santos max-map example without a named published workflow target. This is a topic choice/proposer-angle failure; future work here needs a genuinely new correction/calibration rule, not another negative bootstrap witness.

# pid_bound_intersection_inference / v1 â€” Failed

**Topic.** New topic: inference for nonparametric partial-identification bound intersections over rich or continuous covariate level sets. Pre-anchor check: closest published anchors are Manski nonparametric bounds, Imbens-Manski confidence intervals, Chernozhukov-Hong-Tamer set inference, and Andrews-Shi moment-inequality inference. Our theorem is not that because the object is the nonregular endpoint functional formed by intersecting estimated level-set bounds as the active level-set geometry changes. Require a concrete nonroutine object: a tangent-cone or EIF-style phase threshold separating unique-active, finite-multi-active, and continuum-active flat-face regimes, plus a hand-derived bootstrap-failure or limit-law witness. If the proposal reduces to ordinary interval intersection, generic moment inequalities, or finite-cell Manski bounds, pivot or stop early.

**Novelty target.** relative-to-literature

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped after two D-0.5 hard REJECT angles: both kernels were subsumed by Chernozhukov-Lee-Rosen intersection-bound active-set inference plus Fang-Santos max/bootstrap theory; failure is topic/proposal choice, not solver weakness.
