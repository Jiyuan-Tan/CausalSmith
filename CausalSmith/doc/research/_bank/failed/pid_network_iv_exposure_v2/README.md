  This was the first retry after patching out `bash -lc`. It exposed a second Windows-specific launcher issue: `codex.exe` is present in WindowsApps but cannot be spawned non-interactively, while the `codex` shim works under execa. The dispatcher was patched again to use `codex` on Windows and to normalize missing stdout/stderr.

# pid_network_iv_exposure / v2 — Failed

**Topic.** Flagship generalization of network-exposure partial ID to IV noncompliance with possibly misspecified treatment and instrumental exposure mappings.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NA

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Pipeline failure: first Windows fix used codex.exe, but WindowsApps aliases return EPERM under non-interactive spawn; Stage -1.1 saw undefined stdout and produced no JSON.
