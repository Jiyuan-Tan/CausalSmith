  - 'Conjecture 1: N-thin-survey (angle1_v1) — tier=field below novelty_target=flagship unless the redraft quotes an explicit open support-gap problem in the no-stayer continuous-DID literature and states a strictly new sharp-bound object beyond generic smoothness interpolation.'
  - 'Conjecture 2: C-wellposed (angle1_v1) — The converse says K_score nonzero, or a nonzero orthogonal score difference, implies a distinct first-order variance; nonzero score differences can have equal information norm unless a variance-gap or covariance condition is added.'
  - 'Conjecture 2: C-wellposed (angle1_v2) — The claimed two-endpoint Whitney modulus is built from the same incomplete Taylor rows; it is missing the sharp integral/Le Gruyer compatibility condition needed for a necessary-and-sufficient C^{1,1} derivative envelope.'

proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run attempted a flagship-tier sharp equivalence theorem among three named continuous-treatment DiD ACR estimators (DHS quantile-matching, dCDH local-linear, continuous-dose TWFE), then pivoted across three angles toward a partial-identification support-gap envelope for ACR(d) under no-stayer, no-near-zero designs. The pivoted partial-ID kernel (clipped-arc C^{1,1} extension program over observable dose-support gaps) was consistently assessed as field-tier and mathematically sound — all reviewers confirmed Conjecture 1 as new — but it never cleared the flagship bar because the novelty framing omitted Armstrong-Kolesar optimal-recovery comparators and failed to name an explicit open no-QUG/minimax frontier. Theorem 2 (point-ID sanity corner) was flagged already-known; Conjecture 2 (C-wellposed) had a residual soundness gap in its falsification certificate, and the common-intercept C^{1,1} compatibility constraints were incompletely specified in intermediate drafts.

# eid_continuous_did_acr_panel / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp non-equivalence and strict-extension theorem between three leading continuous-treatment difference-in-differences estimators for the Average Causal Response (ACR) curve: the nonparametric continuous-treatment DiD of D'Haultfœuille, Hoderlein, Sasaki (2023, Journal of Econometrics) that estimates the marginal ACR via quantile-quantile matching between treatment-intensity strata, the de Chaisemartin-D'Haultfœuille (2024) generalized parallel trends estimator that targets the ACR via local-linear weighting in (cohort, treatment-dose) cells, and the panel TWFE-with-continuous-treatment estimator (the empirical default) that regresses outcome on the interaction of cohort and dose. All three target the population ACR functional ACR(d) = d/dd E[Y(d) - Y(0)] under generalized parallel trends + monotone dose-response. The flagship question (axis b: non-equivalence frontier between three named published continuous-DiD estimators): characterize the sharp boundary in (dose-distribution heterogeneity, cohort-time variation, parallel-trend bandwidth) space at which the three estimators have asymptotically equivalent identifying functionals versus strictly different ACR-limit functionals. The kernel claim is a closed-form spectral non-equivalence theorem: the three estimators identify the same ACR(d) at every interior dose d and achieve identical asymptotic variance if and only if a heterogeneity condition kappa(d) := lambda_max(Sigma_dose(d) Pi_cohort) <= kappa_star holds for every d in the interior of the dose support, where kappa_star is a sharp threshold equal to the smallest singular value of an explicit observable kernel matrix combining the dose-distribution covariance, the cohort-period treatment-share matrix, and the parallel-trend smoothness bandwidth; when kappa(d) > kappa_star on a non-trivial dose set, the DHS quantile-matching estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound, the dCDH local-linear estimator is consistent but inefficient by a factor proportional to the bandwidth-misspecification rate, and the TWFE estimator is biased proportional to the cohort-dose interaction excess. kappa_star is a NEW mathematical object computable from observable second moments + cohort-period treatment shares + parallel-trend bandwidth, NOT an existence/absence statement from prior work. Recovers TWFE consistency under homogeneous dose-cohort assignment (kappa(d)=0 for all d) and provides the first sharp triple-non-equivalence boundary for continuous-treatment DiD ACR identification in closed form.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**D-0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**D0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** D-0.5 NO-PASS: angle 0 v1-v5 REVISE@flagship (5×, capped), angle 1 v1 REVISE@field → v2 REJECT@field (collapsed), angle 2 v1-v5 REVISE@field (cap). Continuous-DiD ACR non-equivalence kernel briefly recognized as flagship axis-b but proposer couldn't tighten angle 0 within cap, then degraded across pivots. Math sound at field tier.
