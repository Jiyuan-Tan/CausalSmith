proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a new partial-ID topic for staggered-adoption DiD with interval-censored adoption dates, using endpoint certificates over latent timing refinements and opposite-sign observational-equivalence witnesses. The reviewer repaired away correctness issues by v3, but the remaining kernel stayed field-tier: close ambiguous-timing/misclassified-DiD literature already covers wrong signs and ATT bounds, leaving the proposed Gamma_lambda(P) geometry as an incremental refinement. This is a topic/proposal-strength failure rather than reviewer strictness or D0 solver weakness; future attempts should not revisit interval-censored DiD unless they bring a genuinely nonroutine estimator/inference object beyond finite refinement bounds.

# pid_interval_censored_adoption / v1 â€” Failed

**Topic.** New topic: sharp partial identification for staggered-adoption DiD when adoption time is interval-censored rather than observed exactly. Pre-anchor check: closest published anchors are Sun-Abraham and Callaway-Sant'Anna group-time ATT identification with known adoption cohorts, plus Honest-DiD sensitivity work; our theorem is not that because the latent adoption-date refinement is unobserved, so the target is the geometry of all event-time ATT paths compatible with coarsened cohort bins. Require a concrete nonroutine object: an endpoint certificate over latent timing refinements and a two-cohort witness where two refinements induce identical observed coarsened panels but opposite event-time contrast signs. Avoid merely reusing LP duality or pretrend sensitivity; if the contribution is only a missing-cell Manski bound, pivot.

**Novelty target.** relative-to-literature

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NONFLAGSHIP-KILL

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped after D-0.5 angle0 v3 remained REVISE@field: repo novelty survived but the kernel was incremental against ambiguous-timing/misclassified DiD comparators, especially Denteh-Kedagni 2026; pivot budget should move to a stronger topic.
