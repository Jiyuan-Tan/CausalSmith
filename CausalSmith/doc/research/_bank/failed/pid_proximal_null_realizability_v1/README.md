proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run tried to separate algebraic proximal bridge null directions from latent-model-realizable null directions, aiming for two observed laws with the same bridge quotient but different sharp ATE sets. The idea did not produce a verified finite witness: the displayed latent law failed its own bridge-segment arithmetic, the Farkas certificate was unfinished, and the characterization collapsed toward generic latent-class feasibility. Future work would need a hand-solved finite table before rerunning this topic.

# pid_proximal_null_realizability / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Latent-realizability of proximal bridge-null directions. Pre-anchor check: closest anchors are proximal causal inference without unique bridges, the published null-annihilator quotient criterion, and finite negative-control latent-class formulations. Why non-trivial? The target is not the already-solved algebraic row-space criterion and not an LP/Manski bound: require a finite observed negative-control law where the bridge equation has algebraic null directions, but only some null directions are induced by valid latent negative-control causal models with nonnegative latent strata and exclusion restrictions. The theorem should characterize the realizable null cone and prove a non-equivalence witness: two observed laws with the same bridge operator nullspace and same algebraic quotient certificate, but different sharp ATE sets because one null direction is latent-model-realizable and the other is a spurious bridge-fiber artifact. Why promising? The nonroutine object is a realizability certificate separating algebraic bridge fibers from causal latent-model fibers, with a hand-derived 2x3 or 3x3 witness and endpoint-attaining latent laws. If the delta reduces to LP duality, Manski missing-cell bounds, standard null-annihilator algebra, or definition-unfold latent-class feasibility, pivot or accept field-tier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped after the final budgeted attempt failed to reach flagship: angle 0 stayed field-tier and needed a pivot because its finite witness/Farkas certificate was invalid, then angle 1 rejected at field tier; the latent-realizability topic remained a generic finite LP/projection feasibility problem without a verified nonroutine witness.
