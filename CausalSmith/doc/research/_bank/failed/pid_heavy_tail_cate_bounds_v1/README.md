  - 'Theorem 2: C-sanity — The claimed alpha->infty equality to the bounded-support Manski-MSM width contradicts the proposal''s own Exhibit 9.3, where the Hölder limit is only a loose upper bound and not the stated width.'
  - 'Conjecture 1: C-wellposed — W_Gamma is defined as the no-tail-restriction case ''beyond integrability'', but the necessity branch ranges over alpha*(P;x,a) <= 1 laws where the conditional mean and hence CATE width may be undefined without an extended-expectation convention.'
  - 'Theorem 1: C-coherence — The §4 formula includes an extra c(alpha) while §8 defines only c_Gamma=(Gamma-1)Gamma^{-1/alpha}; the proof sketch''s Hölder factor also uses Gamma^{1-1/alpha}, so the constants do not cohere.'
  - 'Conjecture 1: N-mischar — The proposal says YadlowskyNamkoongBasuDuchiTian2022Bounds assumes bounded outcomes for its closest CATE bound, but the paper is formulated for real-valued outcomes and explicitly develops CATE/ATE bounds under Gamma-selection bias.'
  - 'Theorem 2: N-pub — The bounded-support Manski/MSM specialization is not novel relative to KallusMaoZhou2019CATEIntervals and Manski1990AERBounds.'

proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a moment-existence dichotomy for sharp MSM(Gamma) CATE width under heavy-tailed (unbounded) outcomes, claiming finite width iff E[|Y|^alpha | X,A] < inf for some alpha > 1. The core converse witness (Conjecture 2 / Conjecture 3) collapsed: the truncated-Pareto construction has finite support for every finite n and proves only divergence along a sequence, not an actual neighborhood witness satisfying W_Gamma(P') = +inf. The headline comparators were also mischaracterized: Yadlowsky et al. 2022 is formulated for real-valued outcomes, not bounded-outcome-only, which narrows the claimed gap. One genuinely novel object survives — the Pareto-extremal converse witness concept (Conjecture 2 rated 'new' on both repo and published axes) — but the surrounding kernel collapsed before any Lean formalization was attempted.

# pid_heavy_tail_cate_bounds / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of the conditional average treatment effect when the propensity score is bounded away from {0,1} but the outcome regression admits heavy tails (no uniform sub-Gaussian / sub-exponential moment bound). Find a regime-opening or strict-extension result on the bound width and its dependence on a heavy-tail index alpha.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Discovery NO-PASS after 5 angles (0-4); best tier=field; blocking: N-mischar on KMZ/Yadlowsky comparators, C-sanity on converse witness and Manski-limit theorem.
