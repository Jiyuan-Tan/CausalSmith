  Studied full-population ATE minimax estimation over one-sided weak-overlap classes (left propensity tail P(e(X) <= lambda) of order lambda^kappa, right tail regular). The positive machinery is sound and reusable: a clipped-score upper envelope U_n(lambda), its tail-order surrogate R_n, the clipping-frontier functional R_n^* with an explicit power-rate / phase-boundary characterization, an estimator-side achievability bound, and a parametric root-n lower floor. The math FAILS at the headline: the advertised sharp shell-sensitive weak-overlap minimax FRONTIER is not delivered — the class-uniform comparison U_n ≍ R_n is only per-law (not uniform over the class), so the floor-and-achievability sandwich matches exactly only on the already-root-n sub-regime and the true minimax rate off it stays OPEN; the strict-deterioration comparator is a clipped-estimator surrogate, not the minimax risk. Reraisable (retry) once a class-uniform U_n ≍ R_n comparison and a shell-matching converse (lower bound at the R_n^* rate) exist.

# stat_ate_overlap_decay / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Minimax estimation rate for the ATE under structure-agnostic nuisance estimation when overlap decays one-sidedly near the propensity-score boundary. Focal object: the minimax rate threshold as a joint function of the overlap-decay exponent and nuisance smoothness, characterizing the regime where one-sided overlap decay strictly changes the achievable ATE rate relative to the bounded-overlap structure-agnostic result.

**Novelty target.** relative-to-literature

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage 0.5 decision FAIL — headline sharp weak-overlap minimax frontier (conj:minimax-frontier) underdelivered: the class-uniform U_n≍R_n comparison and R_n^* upper frontier are not discharged (scope_overreach_on_rate_premise + hidden_fold_structure + nonuniform_comparison_gap), leaving a parametric lower floor plus estimator-side O_P(U_n) achievability; crossfit-estimator / tail-order-reduction kernel is reusable (solver-blocked).

## Key files

- `stat_ate_overlap_decay_v1_state.json` — pipeline state at banking (`banked: true`).
- `stat_ate_overlap_decay_v1_proposal.tex` — final proposal version.
- `stat_ate_overlap_decay_v1.tex` — derivation note (if Stage 0 ran).
- `stat_ate_overlap_decay_v1_reviews.jsonl` — per-round reviewer log (Stage -0.5 and Stage 0.5).
- `reviews/` — per-version reviewer JSON files (if present).

## Notes

Banked FAILED per operator decision: the math fails at the headline but the
kernel is reusable (`reusable: solver_blocked`, `reraise_status: retry`).

**Re-use, don't re-derive:** the weak-overlap class definitions, the
envelope/surrogate/frontier construction, the power-rate + phase-boundary
lemmas, the estimator-side achievability bound, and the parametric floor
(`discovery/core.json`, `discovery/writeup.tex`).

**The single open blocker (what to build before re-raising):** a
*class-uniform* comparison `c_1 R_n <= U_n <= c_2 R_n` (the current constants
are law-specific) plus a *shell-matching converse* — a minimax lower bound at
the `R_n^*` rate off the root-n sub-regime. Until those exist, the headline
sharp weak-overlap minimax frontier cannot be closed and only the
floor-and-achievability sandwich holds.

The FAIL verdict is preserved verbatim in `review_decision.json`; the
supporting revise findings in `review_general.json`.
