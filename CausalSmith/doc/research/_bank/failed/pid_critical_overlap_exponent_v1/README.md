proof_attempt_summary: |
  This run should not be read as a mathematical rejection of the overlap-exponent topic. The live copy failed at D-1.1 JSON parsing; the earlier BROKEN_envbug copy harvested a useful literature map but then skipped the proposal and proposal-review stages, allowing D0 to run with no conjectures. Treat this as a pipeline failure and, if revisiting the topic, restart from the literature map rather than resuming the banked state.

# pid_critical_overlap_exponent / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of CATT under bounded overlap violation via a critical overlap exponent controlling interval-width growth near e(x)=0 or 1.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NA

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Past attempt failed as a pipeline/env issue: Stage -1.1 emitted no parseable JSON in the active copy; the BROKEN_envbug copy showed D-1.2/D-0.5 skipped and D0 ran with zero conjectures.
