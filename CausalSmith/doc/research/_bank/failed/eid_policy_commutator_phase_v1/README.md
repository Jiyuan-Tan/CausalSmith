  - "Angle 1 v2: D-0.5 REJECT at field tier; revision still did not make the ordered-policy commutator an independent object."

proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run tried to build a flagship non-equivalence theorem for two longitudinal support-preserving policy operators: odds-multiplier IPSI and natural-value/LMTP intervention. The promising-looking commutator collapsed because the pipeline either restated standard extended-g-formula identification or defined a zero-product coefficient instead of deriving it from two explicit ordered policy means. Future work in this neighborhood needs a genuinely independent operator algebra or a published comparator-facing theorem, not another finite policy-kernel product identity.

# eid_policy_commutator_phase / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Policy-intervention commutator phase for longitudinal causal effects. Pre-anchor check: closest published anchors are Kennedy's incremental propensity-score interventions, longitudinal/resource-constrained IPSI work, Richardson-Robins natural-value interventions, and Diaz-style longitudinal modified treatment policies. Why non-trivial? The target is not another positivity-free identification formula or EIF/path-derivative calculation: require a finite two-time binary transition-kernel witness in which applying an odds-multiplier IPSI and a natural-value modified treatment policy in opposite orders gives two identified but unequal stochastic-policy estimands, plus a closed-form commutator coefficient whose zero set is exactly the no treatment-confounder-feedback/no effect-modification phase. Why promising? The nonroutine object is a hand-derived operator non-equivalence certificate, not a sensitivity bound: a minimal law showing that two standard policy classes that each preserve support do not compose commutatively under longitudinal feedback. If the delta reduces to standard g-formula identification, EIF calculus, or resource-constraint Lagrange multipliers, pivot or accept field-tier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after repeated D-0.5 failures: angle 0 was not-publishable, angle 1 remained field-tier and then rejected after revision, and angle 2 rejected at letter tier; the policy-commutator topic collapsed into standard g-formula/policy-kernel algebra or an under-defined zero-product phase rather than a flagship operator non-equivalence theorem.
