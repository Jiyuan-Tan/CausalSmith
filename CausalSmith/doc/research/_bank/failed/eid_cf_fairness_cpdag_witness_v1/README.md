  - "The evidence placed the topic in structural causal model counterfactual fairness, path-specific/cross-world mediation identification, and graphical-model equivalence-class reasoning rather than the allowed econometric identification, partial-identification, panel, or causal-ML orthogonality clusters."
  - "The suggested salvage was to drop fairness/path-specific semantics and re-run as an ordinary MPDAG/CPDAG total-effect invariance problem for P(Y | do(A)) over DAG completions."

proof_attempt_summary: |
  This attempt proposed a graph-theoretic orientation witness for counterfactual fairness under imperfect causal graphs. It failed before proposal review because thmsmith classified fairness/path-specific CPDAG orientation semantics as outside the allowed discovery clusters. The reusable lesson is to keep future graph topics inside ordinary econometric total-effect invariance or exact-identification questions, not fairness-specific counterfactual notions.

# eid_cf_fairness_cpdag_witness / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Counterfactual-fairness CPDAG orientation witness: a Markov-equivalence orientation certificate for path-specific unfair effects under imperfect causal graphs.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NA

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -1.1 rejected the topic as out-of-scope: the CPDAG counterfactual-fairness/path-specific orientation certificate lives in fairness and graphical-model equivalence-class reasoning rather than the allowed econometric identification, partial-identification, panel, or causal-ML orthogonality clusters.
