proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run tried to convert IDA/MPDAG possible-effect enumeration into a flagship selective-inference theorem for the selected extremal causal effect. The core object never became concrete: the proposal invoked an affine discovery certificate but did not derive it from a named discovery rule with explicit statistic thresholds, so reviewers treated the result as a field-tier instantiation of Lee selective inference plus IDA enumeration. A retry would need a fully worked PC-stable or GES certificate example before making any flagship claim.

# eid_ida_selective_pivot / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Selective-inference pivot for IDA/MPDAG possible causal effects. Pre-anchor check: closest published anchors are IDA and joint-IDA possible-effect multisets (Maathuis-Kalisch-Buhlmann), Perkovic/Guo-Perkovic minimal enumeration for MPDAG possible effects, and Lee-Sun-Sun-Taylor polyhedral selective inference after model selection. Why non-trivial? The target is not another MPDAG orientation criterion or adjustment-set enumeration: require a hand-derived polyhedral selection certificate for the event that a particular DAG completion/effect is the reported extremal possible effect, and an exact truncated-Gaussian pivot for inference on that selected extremal causal effect under linear-Gaussian SEMs. Why promising? The nonroutine object is estimator/inference geometry: the IDA max-effect selection event becomes a finite intersection of affine inequalities in regression coefficient estimates, with a two-completion witness showing naive Wald coverage fails while the selective pivot is exact. If the delta reduces to IDA enumeration, standard adjustment, constrained-gradient geometry, or ordinary post-selection inference without a causal-effect selection map, pivot or accept field-tier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after the selective-IDA topic failed to reach flagship: angle 0 stayed field-tier through three revisions and was killed as nonflagship, then angle 1 rejected as not-publishable; the proposal did not deliver a concrete discovery-rule certificate or a flagship post-selection causal inference object.
