proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run upgraded the field-tier ordinal principal-strata parent by isolating a K=3 shared-middle witness, naming C_mid and n_mid, and deriving coherent versus pairwise endpoints T_mid and T_pair with Delta_mid_sym(Gamma) > 0. The finite symmetric-cell algebra survived review, but the flagship claim collapsed because the open-neighborhood phase was assumed rather than proved and the result did not become a generic-class facet theorem or strict extension of a published comparator class. Future work should not retry this exact upgrade unless it brings a primitive perturbation certificate or a genuinely wider theorem beyond the symmetric cell.

# pid_ordinal_principal_facet_phase / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Flagship upgrade of ordinal principal-strata partial identification: derive an explicit K=3 compatibility-facet certificate and phase threshold for strict nonrectangularity beyond pairwise adjacent-stratum bounds. Pre-anchor check: closest banked result is pid_ordinal_principal_strata_v1, accepted only at field tier with an adjacent-chain posterior LP; closest published anchors are Frangakis-Rubin principal stratification and ordinal principal-score / principal-ignorability work. Why non-trivial? The target is not a new-domain LP dual or another Manski interval: require a named facet normal, a minimal K=3 witness law, and a proof that the shared middle stratum creates strict containment of the common-law feasible polytope inside all pairwise relaxations, with an endpoint-attaining certificate. Why promising? The nonroutine object is the hand-derived compatibility facet and strict-containment witness. If the delta reduces to LP duality, support coverage, or definition-unfold frontier algebra, reject or downgrade.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Banking reason.** D0.5 rejected the flagship upgrade on novelty: the K=3 middle-facet algebra was coherent, but the contribution remained a symmetric finite-cell LP endpoint calculation and imported the open-neighborhood phase through an assumption rather than deriving a generic-class theorem.

**Supersedes.** pid_ordinal_principal_strata_v1 (tier=candidates, upgrade_axis=mechanism). The parent now lives in `_bank/downgraded/` (the `candidates` tier was retired 2026-07-18 and the parent re-graded subfield) and remains an independent reference; this entry is the flagship upgrade.
