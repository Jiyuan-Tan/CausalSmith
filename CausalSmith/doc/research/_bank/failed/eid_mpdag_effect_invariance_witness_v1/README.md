  - "Definition 3.1 uses the same invariance/non-invariance target over DAGs represented by the MPDAG."
  - "Proposition 3.2 gives the failure condition when a proper possibly causal path starts with an undirected edge."
  - "Theorem 3.6 proves sufficiency when no such path exists."
  - "The topic was also classified as graphical MPDAG/CPDAG/PAG identification theory, outside CausalSmith's econometric-methodology scope except as field-tier formalization of known results."

proof_attempt_summary: |
  This attempt salvaged the previous fairness graph idea into an ordinary MPDAG/CPDAG total-effect invariance theorem for P(Y | do(A)). It failed before proposal review because the exact orientation-cut criterion is already in Perkovic 2020, including the undirected-first-edge obstruction and sufficiency result. Future nearby work should not target graph-identification certificates directly; use MPDAG/PAG enumeration only as input to an econometric inference or efficiency question.

# eid_mpdag_effect_invariance_witness / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** MPDAG total-effect invariance witness for P(Y | do(A)): an orientation-cut certificate over DAG completions.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NA

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -1.1 rejected the topic as already solved: Perkovic 2020 already gives the necessary-and-sufficient MPDAG total-effect identification/invariance criterion, including the undirected first-edge failure condition and sufficiency theorem.
