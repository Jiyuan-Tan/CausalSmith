reusable: not_reusable
reraise_status: true-negative
gap_reasons:
  - angle0_v1: "N-pub: The L=2 0011 identity table is just the order-2 binary de Bruijn counterbalance property already covered by AguirreMattarMagisWeinberg2011/de Bruijn theory."
  - angle0_v1: "N-thin-anchor: tier=field below novelty_target=flagship; the proposal anchors only to abstract-level absence claims, not a published open problem or precise section/equation where the causal exact-ID frontier is left unresolved."
  - angle0_v1: "C-definitional-unfold: the iff is the standard linear observation-map rank criterion plus the standard de Bruijn length count."
  - angle0_v2: "N-promissory-object: L^star(w,c_delta) was the flagship object, but the exhibit computed only the L=2 incidence table and alias vector, not L^star on a worked instance."
  - angle0_v2: "C-tautological-iff: the frontier statement is essentially identified iff L <= L^star while L^star is defined as the supremum of lags at which the same row-span condition holds."
  - angle0_v2: "C-definitional-unfold: the proof route is finite row-space separation plus two-point aliasing, routine Fredholm-alternative machinery."
reusable_artifacts:
  - eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover_v1_proposal_angle0_rejected.tex: contains the best schedule-audit revision and the failed L^star sustained-contrast frontier.
  - eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover_v1_proposal.tex: final pivot seed draft after angle 0 was rejected; useful only for seeing how the pipeline tried to escape.
  - reviews/angle0_v1.json: reviewer diagnosis that de Bruijn coverage is already-known and the rank iff is field-tier.
  - reviews/angle0_v2.json: decisive diagnosis of promissory L^star, comparator drift, and tautological row-space frontier.

proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a non-do-calculus switchback/carryover topic with a concrete table: 0011 gives all length-2 histories once, while 0101 has an alias vector delta=(1,0,-1,0) that changes the all-zero versus all-one policy contrast without changing observed alternating histories. Reviewers accepted the table as concrete but classified it below flagship: de Bruijn counterbalance is already known, and the revised L^star object was both uncomputed and tautologically defined from the same row-space condition. Future switchback attempts need an independent estimator, inference, or multi-unit regular-balanced object with a computed nontrivial frontier before launch; do not relaunch another single-unit row-support audit.

# eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover / v1 - Failed

**Topic.** Switchback experiment carryover identification by de Bruijn schedule certificate: use 0011 versus 0101 to test whether schedule-history incidence can support a flagship carryover-identification frontier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after D-0.5 angle 0 v1 was field-tier and v2 was rejected at letter tier for the same switchback schedule-history incidence object: de Bruijn counterbalance was already known, the L-star frontier was promissory/tautological, and the proof reduced to routine row-space/nullspace separation.

## Key Files

- `eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover_v1_state.json` - pipeline state at banking (`banked: true`).
- `eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover_v1_proposal.tex` - final proposal version.
- `eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover_v1_proposal_angle0_rejected.tex` - rejected v2 schedule-audit revision.
- `eid_switchback_debruijn_carryover_v1_reviews.jsonl` - per-round reviewer log.
- `reviews/` - per-version reviewer JSON files.

## Notes

Reflection:

- Pipeline bug: none during the meaningful run; the process chain was inspected and stopped before banking.
- Topic choice: concrete but too close to known de Bruijn/crossover design and routine row-space identification.
- Proposer angle quality: v2 changed the headline to L^star, but did not compute that object and left it definitionally tied to the same row-space condition.
- Reviewer strictness: appropriate; it caught both already-known counterbalance and the promissory upgraded frontier.
- Solver/math weakness: not a D0 solver issue; the topic failed at proposal novelty.
