  This was a plumbing failure discovered while launching the first real run of the 5-budget batch. Stage -1.1 attempted to call Codex through `bash -lc`; on this Windows host `bash` resolves to WSL, which has no installed distro, so stdout was empty and JSON parsing failed. The dispatcher was patched to call `codex.exe` directly on Windows; retry the same scientific topic under a fresh specialization.

# pid_network_iv_exposure / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Flagship generalization of network-exposure partial ID to IV noncompliance with possibly misspecified treatment and instrumental exposure mappings.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NA

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Pipeline failure: Stage -1.1 used bash -lc on Windows, which resolved to WSL with no installed distro, so Codex returned no parseable JSON before any proposal review.
