proof_attempt_summary: |
  The proposal conjectured a three-region weak-proxy phase diagram for proximal ATE inference indexed by the target-relevant Riesz-certificate scalar rho_n(P). Conjectures 1 and 2 survived all 25 novelty rounds as genuinely new on both repo and published axes; Theorem 1 was correctly demoted to incremental scaffolding. The run exhausted the revision cap on a single recurring C-wellposed flag: latent proximal exchangeability (the assumption linking the finite-sieve functional lambda'*beta to the causal ATE E[Y(1)-Y(0)]) was never added to Assumptions 1-5, and the banked reason further notes that rho_n depends on the minimum singular value of an unobserved operator, leaving the focal scalar not evaluable in observed-data primitives.

# eid_proximal_completeness / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp critical-completeness threshold for proximal identification of long-term ATE via outcome-bridge functions when the completeness condition on negative-control proxies approaches violation

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -1.2 NO-PASS @ flagship (D-1.2 effort=high). 25 reviewer rounds across 4 angles; final angle=4 v5 REVISE@flagship S=0 N=0 C=1. Never advanced past D-0.5. Topic reached flagship shape but the named focal scalar (critical completeness) is an operator-theoretic limit (minimum singular value of an unobserved integral operator), not evaluable in observed-data primitives — recurring C-flag on usability/evaluability of the threshold. Anti-pattern: 'Computable map absent' satisfied in name but not in evaluability. High-effort drafter could not rescue an operator-spectrum focal object.
