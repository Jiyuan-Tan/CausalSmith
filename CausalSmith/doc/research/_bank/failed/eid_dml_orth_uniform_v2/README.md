  This run attempted a sharp spectral non-equivalence frontier (rho_star) characterizing when DML, LRO, and ADML ATE variance reports diverge, pivoting from the v1 failure at the common-EIF population variance collapse. The key objects — exact published variance-report coefficients c_{L,A,n} and c_AD,n, the observable covariance kernel's spectral threshold, and the LRO coefficient subspace C_{L,n} — were never pinned to concrete formulas from the cited papers across three revision angles and five iterations each. The flagship strict LRO-ADML separation was ultimately shown self-contradictory: in the proposal's own finite-support audit design, the ADML coefficient c_AD lies in the outcome-block LRO space, making the assumed LRO-ADML separation vacuous by construction.

**Topic.** Sharp uniform-in-DGP non-equivalence theorem between three leading double machine learning (DML) estimators for the average treatment effect under unconfoundedness: the original DML cross-fit estimator (Chernozhukov, Chetverikov, Demirer, Duflo, Hansen, Newey, Robins 2018, Econometrics Journal), the locally-robust orthogonal-score (LRO) estimator (Chernozhukov-Escanciano-Ichimura-Newey-Robins 2022, Econometrica), and the automatic debiased ML estimator (Chernozhukov-Newey-Singh 2022, Econometrica).

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -0.5 NO-PASS — pivot budget exhausted (3 angles x 5 revise rounds). Math-solve upgrade never tested: D-0.5 novelty reviewer rejected every variant because the banked v1 parent occupies the same kernel slot in the catalogue and cannot be dodged for a sibling re-test.
