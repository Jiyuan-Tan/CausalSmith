proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a flagship estimator-geometry theorem for unequal cross-fitting in DML, first as a fold-spectrum phase certificate and then as a fold-mass sandwich variance. The reviewer found both the object and the witness insufficient: the first was symbolic triangular-array bookkeeping, and the second had an algebraically wrong small-fold variance calculation. Future DML-fold work needs a concrete learner/split primitive and a hand-checked variance identity before it is worth another flagship run.

# eid_dml_fold_spectrum_phase / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Unequal-fold cross-fitting phase threshold for DML causal estimators. Pre-anchor check: closest anchors are Chernozhukov-Chetverikov-Demirer-Duflo-Hansen-Newey-Robins double/debiased ML, standard K-fold cross-fitting implementations, and the AutoID fold-restricted CLT/rate-conversion substrate. Why non-trivial? The target is not ordinary cross-fitting consistency: require a fold-mass spectrum c_k and an explicit phase theorem separating full sqrt(n) asymptotic linearity with variance inflation, vanishing-fold slower-rate regimes, and degenerate leave-one-out limits for orthogonal AIPW/DML scores. Why promising? The nonroutine object is estimator geometry: a hand-derived fold-spectrum certificate and a two-fold triangular-array witness showing the usual DML variance formula fails when one evaluation fold has c_k -> 0. If the delta is only a restatement of sample splitting, path derivatives, or standard CLT bookkeeping, pivot or accept field-tier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after D-0.5 rejected the initial fold-spectrum phase angle as field-tier and rejected the fold-mass sandwich pivot as not-publishable; the DML unequal-fold topic collapsed into standard triangular-array/variance bookkeeping with broken witness claims.

## Notes

Reflection: this was a topic/proposal-strength failure with a math-kernel weakness, not reviewer strictness or a D0 solver issue. The idea had a plausible estimator-geometry shape, but without a concrete nuisance-learner process the fold-mass object collapsed into standard triangular-array variance bookkeeping. No pipeline bug was observed after launch; the shell timeout did not kill the pipeline, so the active heartbeat was checked, the run was stopped manually, and `bank_entry.ts` retired it.
