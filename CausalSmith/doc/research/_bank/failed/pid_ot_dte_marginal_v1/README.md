proof_attempt_summary: |
  The proposal attempted to prove an iff covariate-aggregation frontier for overlap-restricted DTE path sets (A_D(P)=0 iff conditional and pooled OT path sets coincide), but the headline kernel was never established: Conjecture 1 (the cycle-frontier criterion) was refuted by a clean one-cell binary counterexample showing Gamma(P,0)=0 yet Theta_I != Theta_L, while Conjecture 2 (open-set strict-containment witness) was filed as confirmed but all three stage-0.5 reviewers found its core finite LP certificate, pastability-to-single-potential lemma, and rank-tube constraints asserted rather than derived. The validated output — the factual-compatibility counterexample and the outer-envelope inclusion — is mathematically sound and real, but falls below the flagship novelty floor on its own; the path forward is a reframed proposal built around the factual-compatibility correction as the focal theorem.

# pid_ot_dte_marginal / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of distributional treatment effects via optimal-transport extremal couplings under marginal-overlap restrictions on counterfactual outcome distributions

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** REVISE

**Banking reason.** Stage -1.2 NO-PASS @ flagship after 4 pivots (budget exhausted). Path: angles cycled through OT pooled-vs-conditional DTE envelope, finite diagnostics, dependence lattice, lifted-OT pasting; one angle reached D-0.5 ACCEPT but D-0.5→0 review fired proposal_promise_gap=kernel_substituted/direction_only/constructive_object_missing (Conj-2 witness lacked finite LP certificate; load-bearing pastability lemma asserted not derived). Surviving Conj-1 refutation + outer-envelope inclusion is sound but field-tier only, does not clear flagship novelty floor alone.
