proof_attempt_summary: |
  This attempt targeted a quotient bridge certificate showing that bridge nonuniqueness can coexist with point identification of the ATE when null bridge directions have zero target contrast. It failed before proposal review because the exact nullspace orthocomplement criterion is already published. Future proximal topics should build on that result, for example by studying inference for estimated quotient certificates or model-realizable null directions, not by reproving the algebraic criterion.

# eid_proximal_bridge_quotient / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Proximal bridge quotient identification without completeness: target uniqueness under nonunique outcome bridges.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NA

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -1.1 rejected the topic as already solved: Zhang, Li, Miao, and Tchetgen Tchetgen already give the bridge-nullspace orthocomplement criterion for identifying a linear functional of a nonunique outcome bridge.
