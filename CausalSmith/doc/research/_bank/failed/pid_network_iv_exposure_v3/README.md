proof_attempt_summary: |
  Attempted a flagship generalization of `pid_network_exposure/v1` from treatment-exposure misspecification to network IV with noncompliance and a second instrumental exposure map. The literature gap was real and reviewer repeatedly marked repo/published novelty clear, but every promising angle collapsed on the same mathematical burden: no valid non-corner witness and no well-pinned finite LP/MILP normalization. Treat this as a topic-choice failure, not reviewer over-strictness; the next run should avoid network-IV compatibility witnesses unless a concrete witness is constructed by hand first.

# pid_network_iv_exposure / v3 — Failed

**Topic.** Flagship generalization of the banked network-exposure partial-ID result: sharp partial identification of complier direct and spillover effects when both the treatment exposure mapping and the instrumental exposure mapping may be misspecified, bridging exposure-mapping robustness with IV noncompliance and producing a computable finite-network sharp bound plus a small worked witness.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stage -0.5 NO-PASS after 5 angles: network-IV exposure upgrade repeatedly had a plausible literature gap but failed flagship proposal review on uncomputed/infeasible witnesses, promissory transport/frontier objects, and LP well-posedness.

**Supersedes.** pid_network_exposure_v1 (tier=candidates, upgrade_axis=generalization). The parent now lives in `_bank/downgraded/` (the `candidates` tier was retired 2026-07-18 and the parent re-graded subfield) and remains an independent reference; this entry is the flagship upgrade.
