    reason: "Angle 0 stayed field-tier through two versions; reviewers found the population criterion already known, comparator anchors thin, Pi_N/Dkappa underdefined, and the local cone-angle law insufficient for flagship novelty."
proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run tried to build an inference theory around the already-known proximal bridge quotient criterion by estimating the bridge operator, target loading, and angle to the bridge nullspace. The idea remained coherent but incremental: reviewers treated the population result as already known and the local diagnostic as standard rank/weak-identification perturbation without a named proximal comparator theorem being strictly extended. A future retry would need a complete uniform inference/pretest theorem with explicit Pi_N and Dkappa maps and concrete comparator non-representability.

# eid_proximal_quotient_inference_phase / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Weak-quotient inference phase for proximal bridge target uniqueness. Pre-anchor check: closest anchors are the Zhang-Li-Miao-Tchetgen Tchetgen null-annihilator criterion for nonunique bridges, proximal AIPW bridge estimation papers, and weak-identification/singular-matrix inference. Why non-trivial? The target is not the already-solved algebraic quotient criterion and not another completeness threshold: require a fixed-rank finite negative-control model where the bridge operator and target loading are estimated, and derive a local-to-nullspace phase theorem for the plug-in quotient diagnostic. The nonroutine object is a cone-angle certificate: when the target-loading distance to the estimated bridge nullspace is separated from zero, ordinary Gaussian inference is valid; when it is n^{-1/2}-local, the diagnostic has a nonstandard projected-Gaussian/chi-bar-square law and naive quotient-identification decisions have nonvanishing size distortion. Why promising? This is estimator geometry around a published identification criterion, with a two-matrix hand witness and explicit phase boundary, not LP duality or support coverage. If the delta reduces to standard singular-value perturbation, generic weak-IV analogies, path derivatives, or rephrasing the Zhang nullspace iff, pivot or accept field-tier.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REVISE

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Stopped early after repeated D-0.5 field-tier reviews: the proximal quotient inference topic was coherent but remained an incremental rank/weak-identification diagnostic around the already-known Zhang null-annihilator criterion, without a flagship comparator-facing uniform inference theorem.
