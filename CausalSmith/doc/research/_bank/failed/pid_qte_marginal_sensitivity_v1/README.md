proof_attempt_summary: |
  The proposal attempted to identify a novel 'Tukey-factor tail collapse' for conditional quantile treatment effects (CQTE) under covariate-wise Rosenbaum odds-ratio bounds, targeting a canonical minimal quotient and finite active-rank certificate for threshold-coded CQTE claims. After 3 angles and 9 review iterations (5 on the final angle), the surviving core — Background Lemma A and a rank-separation witness (Theorem 1) — was rated incremental over Wang2026's process-level QTE envelopes and Winkler1988's moment-set geometry, while Conjectures 1 and 2 remained unproved open questions. The proposal consistently landed at tier=letter instead of the required tier=field, blocked by the N-thin-survey flag: the arbitrary-K rank-gap and quotient-certificate layer was judged an audit abstraction over existing envelope results rather than a field-level inferential or identification advance.

# pid_qte_marginal_sensitivity / v1 — Failed

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of conditional quantile treatment effects under marginal Rosenbaum-style sensitivity, where the worst-case odds ratio of treatment-assignment is bounded covariate-by-covariate, with closed-form quantile-curve envelopes recovering Manski-Pepper at the trivial bound and point identification under unconfoundedness

**Novelty target.** field

**D-0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**D0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** D-0.5 NO-PASS after 15 revises; angle=2 v5 verdict=REVISE tier=letter (below novelty_target=field floor).
