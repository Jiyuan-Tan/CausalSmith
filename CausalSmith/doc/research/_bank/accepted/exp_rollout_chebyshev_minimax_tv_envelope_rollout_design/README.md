# exp_rollout_chebyshev_minimax / tv_envelope_rollout_design — Accepted

**Topic.** Optimal Chebyshev-spaced rollout measurement schedule and minimax linear-unbiased total-treatment-effect estimation under β-order network interference (Cortez et al. 2024, arXiv:2405.05119): over a Sobolev-ellipsoid β-order coefficient class, WHICH treated-fractions to roll out to is the design variable; the optimum is Chebyshev-spaced, and the minimax linear-unbiased estimator attains a worst-case design-variance β-exponent (C_s(c)/q)^{2β} with a matching lower bound from the classical Chebyshev extremal property — resolving whether Cortez et al.'s (β/q)^{2β} interpolation-variance penalty is intrinsic (exponential ORDER 2β fixed, BASE reducible via additional measurement points k=⌈cβ⌉)

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** PASS

**Banking reason.** Matched two-sided Chebyshev-Lobatto minimax over the TV-envelope rollout-node-placement design problem (base rho(q)/q, field tier); both substrate gates (Ehlich-Zeller/Bernstein-Szego + finite-dim l1/linf duality) proven 0-sorry axiom-clean via study sub-pipelines.
