# eid_lingam_direction_min_order_v1 / truncated_cumulant_minimality — Accepted

**Topic.** Chen et al.'s (arXiv:2510.22711, 2025) order-(2m+3) higher-cumulant rank-deficiency test for the causal DIRECTION between two variables X,Y under m non-collinear latent confounders is NOT minimal: the direction is GENERICALLY identifiable from the joint cumulant tensor TRUNCATED at order 2m+2 (one order lower). Kernel: reading the stacked truncated cumulant tensor T_{2m+2}(X,Y) as two axis-conditioned graded cumulant-image varieties (a simultaneous binary-form / Sylvester decomposition), prove (I) [strict lower-order sufficiency] the two opposite-arrow cumulant-image varieties GENERICALLY SEPARATE at K=2m+2, so the arrow is recovered off a proper subvariety via the simultaneous-binary-form recovery map — strictly improving the anchor's order-2m+3 requirement (minimal order K*(m)=2m+2, pinned by the DOF balance p=nK-1 vs q with n=m+2); and (II) [exact exceptional non-ID locus] the two varieties INTERSECT in an explicit CODIMENSION-m exceptional variety E_m (the axis-conditioned Waring-alternative compatibility system) on which an opposite-arrow twin shares T_{2m+2}, so identification fails exactly on E_m — give E_m's defining equations and prove codim E_m = m. Deliver worked m=1 (order-4 truncation, E_1 codim-1) and m=2 (order-6, E_2 codim-2) instances then the general dichotomy. Motif M18 (structure identification: recover the arrow up to the direction indeterminacy via cumulant asymmetry; recovery map + exceptional locus are the indeterminacy characterization). ExactID structure-ID; distinct from coefficient-identification (pins the minimal cumulant ORDER and the exceptional locus of ARROW identifiability, not a coefficient's value).

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** PASS

**Banking reason.** F4 dual reviewers converged: three salvaged headline results are unconditional and proved; the exact-real atlas is independently verified secondary, unconsumed, and disclosed as an undelivered remark.
