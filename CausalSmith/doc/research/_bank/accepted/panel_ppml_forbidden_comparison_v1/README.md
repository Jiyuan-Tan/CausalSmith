  The run proved the unit-FE PPML collapse, unique pseudo-true projection,
  effect-dependent weighted-FWL derivative sign theorem, primitive global
  frontier, and an explicit T=4 positive-effect sign-reversal witness. It also
  proved positive counterfactual-share PTT aggregation and its population ratio
  identity, while deliberately leaving fixed-T influence-function and analytical-
  variance theory outside the accepted scope.

**Topic.** Multiplicative Goodman-Bacon for staggered Poisson difference-in-differences: characterize the probability limit of the naive two-way (unit+time) fixed-effects PPML single-coefficient estimand under staggered adoption with heterogeneous multiplicative (proportional) treatment effects, and derive the sharp forbidden-comparison sign condition sign(d beta*/d delta_gt) = sign(Wtilde_gt), where Wtilde is the pseudo-true-weight (weighted-FWL) residual of the treatment indicator partialled against the unit and time fixed effects — showing a cohort with a larger true positive proportional effect can strictly lower the reported coefficient via already-treated cohorts acting as effective controls (the Poisson/multiplicative analog of Goodman-Bacon 2021 and de Chaisemartin-D'Haultfoeuille 2020, whose linear weighted-sum decomposition is Jensen-obstructed in the multiplicative case per Moreau-Kastler 2025). Deliver: (K1) an implicit PPML projection theorem — beta* is the unique pseudo-true root of the misspecified FE-Poisson score (White 1982), closed-form in a 2-cohort/3-period minimal instance, not a convex combination of the delta_gt; (K2) the effect-dependent sign condition with derivative E[Wtilde_it * d mu_it/d delta_gt] / E[w*_it Wtilde_it^2], the characterization of forbidden (negative-Wtilde) cells, and a proven-non-vacuous 2x3 instance; (K3) the corrected counterfactual-share-weighted proportional ATT PTT = sum omega_gt delta_gt (positive weights) with the influence function and consistent analytical asymptotic variance of the imputation ratio-of-ratios estimator, open in Moreau-Kastler 2025. Substrate: Wooldridge 2023 multiplicative parallel trends E[Y_it(0)|i,t]=exp(alpha_i+gamma_t).
