# stat_policy_regret_margin_overlap / v1 — Accepted

**Topic.** Matching minimax characterization of the offline policy-learning welfare-regret rate under one-sided overlap decay and a Tsybakov margin. Estimand: expected welfare regret E[R(pi_hat) - inf_pi R(pi)] of a learned treatment-assignment policy (a risk functional of P; point-identified under strict overlap, so this is an estimation-RATE problem, not identification). THEOREM TO PROVE, two directions: (T1 achievability) a trimmed/clipped-AIPW-score ERM, with propensity clipping threshold t_n tied to a one-sided polynomial overlap-decay exponent gamma (e(x) -> {0,1} like distance-to-boundary^gamma) and operating under a Tsybakov margin exponent alpha at the decision boundary tau(x)=0, attains E[R(pi_hat) - inf R(pi)] <= C n^{-r(alpha,gamma)} with r(alpha,gamma) in closed form; (T2 converse, THE CORE CONTRIBUTION) a localized fuzzy-hypothesis (Le Cam / many-hypothesis) construction with propensity shrinking pi_lambda ~ h^rho on local cubes, whose LOCAL OVERLAP-MARGIN CALIBRATION LEMMA (the Hellinger/KL-equalizing balance among the regret-separation height, the propensity-decay height, and the local cube geometry) is derived explicitly, giving a minimax lower bound n^{-r(alpha,gamma)} matching T1. The named focal object is this calibration lemma plus the matched exponent r(alpha,gamma); the (alpha,gamma) phase boundary (margin-driven branch vs overlap-limited branch) is READ OFF the closed calibration, not assumed. Differentiation: Athey-Wager Ecta'21 give n^{-1/2} under strict overlap with no margin; Luedtke-Chambaz give the margin-alpha fast rate under strict positivity (load-bearing only via influence-function boundedness); Bibaut et al. 2510.15483 treat ONLINE cumulative bandit regret, upper-bound only, with a constant overlap floor and no minimax converse. This proposal is FIXED offline one-sided overlap decay with a matching lower bound, explicitly distinct from adaptive diminishing-exploration policy-learning minimax results.
