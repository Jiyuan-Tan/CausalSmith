  Attempted a flagship sharp-ATE collider-bias identified set headlined as the
  Greenland (2003) / VanderWeele (2009) "open direction": extending their collider-bias
  outer bounds to a sharp identified-set characterization. The §8 conjectures were instead
  cast in a Lee-Gamma selection frame: the strict-tightening (Conj 2) and compatibility-gap
  iff (Conj 3) conjectures are CONFIRMED, and the sharp common-alpha frontier (Conj 1) is
  PARTIAL — proved on the finite-table input, but the headlined external-comparator /
  open-set non-representability clause is explicitly left unproven. No conjecture delivers
  the headlined Greenland/VanderWeele external-comparator result; reviewers found the SGJR/JR
  and Honore-Hu comparators are proposal-defined armwise rectangles, not the named published
  estimators, and the artifact self-downgrades to field tier. The proven Lee-Gamma core is
  sound but mis-headlined; what remains is a sharp finite-table sensitivity bound, not a
  flagship regime-opening extension of the cited collider-bias literature.

# pid_collider_bias_sharp / v1 — Downgraded

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of the average treatment effect under bounded collider bias: a closed-form quadratic identified set for the ATE when an analyst conditions (intentionally or by selection) on a partially-determined post-treatment outcome / mediator / selection indicator, characterized by two extremal joint laws (one saturating the upper envelope, one saturating the lower envelope) of the unobserved structural-error pair, with a non-trivial quadratic-in-the-collider-bias-parameter envelope strictly tighter than the Manski no-assumption bounds whenever any bias bound is finite; extends Greenland (2003) and VanderWeele (2009) collider-bias outer bounds to the sharp identified-set characterization, the direct open direction explicitly left in both papers' discussion sections

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Banking reason.** Split D0 honest: 3 conj verdicts (lee-gamma-frontier=partial; strict-tightening,coupling-iff=confirmed). D0.5 reject NOT solver-side: proposal headlined Greenland/VanderWeele collider envelope but §8 conjectures are Lee-Gamma framed and no §8 conjecture proves the headlined external-comparator clause. Proposal drift detected by upgraded split solver; needs proposal-stage upgrade not solver retry.
