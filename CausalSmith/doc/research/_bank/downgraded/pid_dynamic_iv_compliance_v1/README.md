    one_liner: "Prior work ChenZhang2023 would imply that time-varying IV partial-identification can be organized through Bellman-style dynamic-regime objects. Our seed conjectures that Bellman or stagewise intervals are nonsharp under non-Markov assignment because one latent compliance response map must be pasted across histories."
    reason: "Pursued as angle 0; full-history LP collapses to standard finite response-type sharpness and a baseline-pooling witness rather than a true Bellman-vs-full-history non-pasting theorem. Stage 0.5 field-tier review judged this subfield, not field. Future runs on the same anchor topic should skip seed 0 unless the kernel is re-stated as a post-baseline full-history separation after retaining all assignment-relevant baseline variables."

# flagship_explore / f1 — Downgraded

**Proposal (D-0.5, ACCEPT after 5 revisions):** field-tier partial-ID
theorem on T=3 dynamic IV with imperfect compliance, claiming history-
separation / no-pasting from one joint dynamic compliance response map, plus
a T<=2 no-separation boundary.

**Derivation (D0.5 field-tier review, REVISE on novelty):** the
constructed LP is correct and reductions to Balke-Pearl and exact-compliance
IPW are valid, but the central content is acknowledged in the note itself as
(a) a standard finite-latent-table sharpness application and (b) a baseline-
pooling coarsening witness. The proposed T<=2 minimality boundary is refuted
by Counterexample s0-t1-counter under the same coarsening convention. Net
content sits at subfield, below the requested field floor.

## Proof attempt summary

A T=3 dynamic IV with binary instruments, treatments, outcomes, and
imperfect compliance was enumerated by latent response type; the standard
finite-type LP was solved over the implied observation operator. The
Markov / stagewise coarsened polytope was shown to strictly contain the
full-history polytope at a concrete (Z, X, Y) draw, with sign-relevant gap
-8/81. The originally proposed T<=2 minimality (full-history strictly
sharper than Markovized at the T<=2 boundary) was disproved at T=1 under the
coarsening convention actually used. The result is correct but, by the
note's own acknowledgement, recovers generic discrete-bound machinery rather
than a new dynamic separation theorem.

## What a field-tier repair would have to do

Per the D0.5 verdict (verbatim): "a field-tier repair would need a
genuinely dynamic post-baseline full-history separation or non-pasting
theorem after retaining assignment-relevant baseline variables." Concretely,
either (i) a post-baseline full-history separation after explicitly carrying
all assignment-relevant baseline variables through the coarsening, or
(ii) a precise non-pasting theorem for local dynamic IV certificates with a
sharp primal/dual witness. Rephrasing the current LP sharpness or the
baseline-pooling witness will not lift the tier.
