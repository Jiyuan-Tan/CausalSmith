  - "Proposition 4 claims the witness satisfies the generic-stratum condition from Conjecture 2.

  - "The main mathematics actually delivered is finite convex geometry of the bridge fiber, a null-annihilator criterion, ... a one-dimensional nonradial selector formula, and one explicit binary table. These are coherent diagnostics, but they are not a flagship regime-opening theorem."  # D0.5 round 2, novelty

  Attempted a flagship sharp proximal-completeness phase transition for the ATE:
  a closed-form critical singular value sigma_star giving strict point / interval /
  Manski phase boundaries when proxy completeness fails. The original angle reached a
  flagship ACCEPT at proposal (angle 1 v3), but the D0.5 derivation collapsed: the
  generic open-class selector-range Conjecture 1 was never proved, the unqualified
  one-dimensional claim was refuted by a radial counterexample, and the binary witness
  (Prop. 4) fails its own generic-stratum condition (A=0 duplicate proxy rows make the
  rank drop unstable under arbitrarily small perturbations). The pivot to a fresh angle 2
  cycled six revisions, only twice touching flagship (last blocked on an undefined
  efficiency-bound object) before the revision cap exhausted to a NO-PASS@flagship.
  Remains: sound field-tier finite convex geometry (null-annihilator criterion, exact-fiber
  Tikhonov limit, nonradial 1-D selector formula) — but no flagship regime-opening theorem.

# eid_proximal_phase / v1 — Downgraded

**Topic.** Sharp identification phase transition for the average treatment effect via proximal causal inference (negative controls) when standard proxy completeness fails. Miao, Geng, and Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018, Biometrika) and Cui, Pu, Shi, Miao, Tchetgen Tchetgen (2024, JASA) established exact point identification of the ATE under unmeasured confounding via the outcome bridge function h(W,A,X) solving E[Y - h(W,A,X) | Z,A,X]=0, provided the completeness condition that g -> E[g(U) | Z,A,X] is injective on a suitable function class. Recent work (Tchetgen Tchetgen, Ying, Cui, Shi, Miao 2024; Kompa, Sturma, Imbens 2024 NBER w34550) studies failure modes when completeness is only approximately satisfied. The flagship question: parametrize completeness by the smallest singular value sigma_min of the projection operator g -> E[g(U) | Z,A,X] restricted to bridge-function residuals, and characterize a sharp phase transition: when sigma_min > sigma_star (a critical threshold computable from the observable proxy distribution and outcome regression), the ATE is exactly point-identified by the proximal IPW/OR estimator; when 0 < sigma_min <= sigma_star, the ATE is identified by a sharp non-trivial interval whose width scales as O(1/sigma_min); when sigma_min = 0 the proximal identification collapses entirely to a Manski-trivial bound. The kernel claim is a sharp closed-form characterization of sigma_star as the smallest singular value of an explicit observable kernel, with strict point/interval/Manski phase boundaries. Recovers Miao-Geng-Tchetgen point identification in the high-completeness regime and provides the first sharp proximal phase transition theorem with computable threshold.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**D-0.5 verdict.** NO-PASS

**D0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Banking reason.** Re-review under widened flagship rubric — D0.5 rejected original derivation, intervention pivoted to fresh angle 2. Angle 2 cycled v0/v2/v3/v4/v5=REVISE@field, v1=REVISE@flagship (single hit), cap exhausted → D-0.5 NO-PASS@flagship. Proximal-completeness kernel briefly tagged flagship under axis (c) extension framing but couldn't hold it across revisions. Math sound at field tier.
