# stat_dp_cate_minimax_v1 / holder_central_dp — Accepted

**Topic.** Differentially private minimax rate for pointwise CATE estimation under Holder smoothness and central (eps,delta)-DP: the sharp two-sided rate for tau(x0)=E[Y(1)-Y(0)|X=x0] pairing a private higher-order-influence-function doubly-robust R-learner (upper bound, with privatized estimation of the alpha-smooth propensity and beta-smooth outcome nuisances) against a localized fingerprinting/tracing lower bound, extending the non-private CATE minimax rate of Kennedy-Balakrishnan-Robins-Wasserman (2024, arXiv 2203.00837) with a derived DP-cost term and a new privacy-dominated regime/phase boundary in (smoothness, dimension, privacy) space; differs from upper-bound-only private-CATE methods (DP-CATE 2503.03486, Niu 2202.11043) and from private pointwise nonparametric regression (Cai-Chakraborty-Vuursteen 2406.06755) by delivering the matching causal-functional lower bound

**Novelty target.** subfield

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** PASS

**Banking reason.** F5-clean: all 7 headline results proven and axiom-clean (barrier, converse, achievability, certified two-sided bracket, sharp beta=gamma rate, regression inheritance); zero substrate gates; F4 converged with both reviewers matched. Banked at novelty tier subfield per user decision.
