  - "The reverse inequality is not reproduced: ...

  Attempted sharp nonparametric Spearman-band identified set for Pr(Y1>Y0) with a
  majority-sign critical-rho* indeterminacy result and Imbens-Manski/Stoye endpoint
  inference. Reviewers accepted the math in WEAKENED form — a computable weak-duality
  OUTER envelope (Theorem 1), an outer-envelope majority-sign DIAGNOSTIC (Theorem 2),
  and a confirmed bootstrap/delta-method endpoint limit law (inference, confirmed) —
  with no defect found in that scoped package. What collapsed is the headline: the
  no-gap (primal=dual) strong-duality EQUALITY that makes the interval sharp was
  demoted to unproved Conjecture 1 (Kellerer marginal duality does not supply the
  uv-Spearman-moment constraint), and "indeterminacy" softened to an outer-bound
  diagnostic. Parked on tier/promise (field→subfield), not novelty: the cold referee
  judged the delivered outer-bound contribution sound but below the field target.

# pid_benefit_concordance_band / v1 — Downgraded

**Topic.** Continuous-outcome nonparametric sharp bounds on the proportion who benefit from treatment, Pr(Y1 > Y0), under a rank-concordance band — Spearman's rho of the potential-outcome copula constrained to [rho_minus, rho_plus] rather than a fixed copula family — with the critical concordance rho* at which the benefit-majority sign (Pr > 1/2 vs < 1/2) becomes data-undetermined; plug-in endpoint estimators and Imbens-Manski/Stoye inference over the partially-identified interval. Differentiate from arXiv:2605.11415 (ordinal latent-threshold, single-family envelope) and Fan-Park Makarov (marginals-only, copula free).

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Banking reason.** D0.5.G cold referee: delivered an exact dual representation + delta-method/bootstrap inference for an OUTER Spearman-band endpoint under strong regularity, not the sharp identified-set equality / sign-indeterminacy result the headline promised — a sound subfield partial-ID contribution, below the field target.
