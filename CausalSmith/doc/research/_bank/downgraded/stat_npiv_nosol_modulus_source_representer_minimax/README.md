  Targeted the intrinsic minimax MODULUS (functional modulus of continuity) for finite-dimensional
  functionals of no-solution NPIV least-squares projections, aiming for the missing converse to
  Shen et al. (2026) achievability. Collapsed at D-0.5: once the well-posedness/summability condition
  is imposed, the LS projection reduces the functional to an exact-solution NPIR linear-functional
  problem (target g^R), whose modulus is classical (Breunig-Johannes/Chen-Reiss/Cai-Low) — so the
  "no-solution" novelty is illusory at the modulus level. The real no-solution novelty (Shen et al.)
  lives in debiased-inference orthogonality / second-order remainder, NOT the first-order modulus.
  Deterrent: do not re-propose a no-solution-MODULUS converse; an inference-frontier kernel is distinct.

# stat_npiv_nosol_modulus / source_representer_minimax — Downgraded

**Topic.** intrinsic minimax modulus (functional modulus of continuity) for finite-dimensional functionals of no-solution NPIV least-squares projections, indexed by spectral-decay, source, and functional-representer source classes — the missing converse to the Tikhonov achievability rate of Shen-Kallus et al (arXiv:2604.24660); deliver a sharp intrinsic-modulus characterization with matched lower and upper bounds where available, and claim Tikhonov rate-suboptimality only if an estimator attaining the faster modulus rate is exhibited

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** No-solution NPIV functional minimax MODULUS is subsumed by exact-solution NPIR/linear-functional theory: the least-squares projection h-dagger exactly solves the projected normal equation T h = g^R, so the functional modulus, envelope, profile rates, Riesz boundary, and Lepski adaptation reduce to classical exact-solution functional-modulus results (Breunig-Johannes/Chen-Reiss/Cai-Low). D-0.5 v4 REJECT, all theorems already-known (N-pub). Genuine no-solution novelty (Shen et al.) lives in debiased-inference orthogonality, not the first-order modulus.
