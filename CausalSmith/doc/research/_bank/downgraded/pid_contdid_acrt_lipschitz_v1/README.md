  - "law-sharp: shallow sharpness — the main sharpness step 'becomes a direct two-point mean-completion construction once the missing inequalities are added', i.e. a definitional unfold, not a new sharpness principle."
  - "law-sharp: narrow causal content — 'the advertised law-sharp interval is sharp only for a very permissive completion class with arbitrary off-arm product kernels, so the causal content is much narrower than the continuous-treatment DiD headline suggests'."
  - "critical-l: 'standard parametric LP basis sensitivity' — not a new threshold object."
  - "plugin-inference: 'conservative pointwise outer coverage by enlarging the feasible set with diverging padding rather than a sharp or broadly usable inference theory'."
  - "overall: 'a real but specialized algebraic partial-identification note, not a field-level contribution' — tier=subfield < field floor, not salvageable within scope."

# pid_contdid_acrt_lipschitz / v1 — Downgraded

**Topic.** Sharp partial identification of the average causal response on the treated ACRT(d) in continuous-treatment difference-in-differences, when the cross-dose selection bias is constrained by a STRUCTURAL cross-dose regularity rather than pointwise: the group-conditional dose-l treatment effect ATT(l|d) (effect of dose l on the group whose actual dose is d) is L-Lipschitz (or monotone) in the conditioning group d. This couples the unidentified selection-bias terms ATT(l|h)-ATT(l|l) -- left unbounded by Callaway-Goodman-Bacon-Sant'Anna (arXiv:2107.02637, Thm 3, with the zero-sum TWFE level-weights of Thm 5) -- into a joint Lipschitz/isotonic nuisance set, so the sharp bounds on ACRT(d) are the image of that convex set under the linear identification map: a finite-grid LP / support-function envelope [L_L(d),U_L(d)], NOT the trivial observed-contrast +/- L*gap. Deliver the sharp envelope, the critical Lipschitz constant L* at which 0 first enters the ACRT(d) interval (dose-response sign undetermined; TWFE-implied sign unidentified), a nonseparability witness showing the joint constraints strictly sharpen the local bounds, and a plug-in estimator of the envelope endpoints with inference over the identified set.

**Novelty target.** relative-to-literature

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** REJECT

**Banking reason.** D0.5.G cold referee under field floor: tier=subfield, not salvageable within scope — shallow two-point mean-completion sharpness, permissive completion class with narrow causal content, standard parametric-LP critical-L, and conservative padded inference; a real but specialized algebraic partial-ID note, not field-level.
