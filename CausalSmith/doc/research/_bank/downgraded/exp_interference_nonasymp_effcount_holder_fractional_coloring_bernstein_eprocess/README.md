proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run proved the finite-sample exposure-HT concentration result and a
  moderate-deviation clique-block same-class confidence-length sandwich whose
  effective count is n/(r 2^r). Independent math and positioning reviews passed,
  but novelty review placed the contribution at subfield rather than the requested
  field tier because the general upper interval is established substrate. A
  field-tier successor would need a genuinely new heterogeneous-network interval
  and matching weighted lower bound, rather than another refinement of this block witness.

# exp_interference_nonasymp_effcount / holder_fractional_coloring_bernstein_eprocess — Downgraded

**Topic.** Exponential-tail, dependency-adaptive nonasymptotic confidence interval for a design-based causal exposure effect under general network interference: for the Horvitz-Thompson exposure estimator theta_hat of an exposure contrast theta=(1/n)sum_i[Y_i(a)-Y_i(b)] under KNOWN Bernoulli assignment with a neighborhood-dependent exposure mapping c_i=g(Z_{N(i)}) and known exposure propensities pi_i(.)>=pi_exp, construct a Holder-normalized fractional-coloring Bernstein e-value over an exact b-fold coloring of the exposure-dependency graph D (i~j iff N(i) cap N(j) nonempty), giving a finite-sample CI |theta_hat-theta| <= sqrt(2 chi_f(D) Vbar log(2/alpha)/n) + chi_f(D) log(2/alpha)/(3 n pi_exp) with observable propensity-only envelope Vbar=n^{-1}sum_i[1/pi_i(a)+1/pi_i(b)], whose half-width tracks the effective independent-exposure count n/chi_f(D) with log(1/alpha) tails -- the first exponential-tail, chi_f-adaptive, general-network finite-sample CI for exposure-HT inference (improving Aronow-Samii's Chebyshev CI), the network-interference lift of the negative-dependence effective-sample-size idea of Sandoval-Balakrishnan-Feller-Jordan-Waudby-Smith 2601.11744

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** REVISE

**Banking reason.** Math review PASS and positioning review PASS, but the independent novelty tier was subfield below the requested field floor.

## Notes

The package was banked at the discovery boundary and did not enter Lean
formalization. The mathematical core is sound and useful as a benchmark, but the
current angle is burned for a field-tier claim. Reuse the verified concentration
and witness machinery only as substrate for a materially broader heterogeneous
construction.
