  First Omega(log T) minimax LOWER bound for adaptive superpopulation Horvitz-Thompson cumulative Neyman regret (resolving the open converse of Neopane-Ramdas-Singh 2024 / Noarov et al. 2025). The D0 math is complete and sound; the novel apparatus (kappa_nu curvature-information complexity, the tangent-regular class, the local->global lift, the recursion->log T accumulation) is fully machine-verified sorry-free. The one irreducible piece — the sequential van Trees / Fisher-tensorization converse engine — needs DQM substrate absent from Mathlib. Threading the whole reduction as one hypothesis was caught by F2.5 as laundering the derived recursion/domination/sup, so the CERTIFIED bank is restricted to the gate-free core; the full converse stays as a documented conditional extension. Re-raise once the DQM/sequential-Fisher substrate is built.

# stat_neyman_regret_minimax / v1 — Downgraded

**Topic.** First matching minimax LOWER bound for Neyman regret in adaptive two-arm experiments, resolving the open problem of Dai et al. (arXiv:2411.14341 Logarithmic Neyman Regret): they prove the upper bound R_T <= O~(f(pi*) log T) for the Clipped-Second-Moment-Tracking design but prove no matching lower bound. Establish the minimax lower bound over bounded-outcome adaptive two-arm instances via a change-of-measure / epoched two-point (Le Cam) construction tying detection-time of the unknown second moments to accumulated quadratic Neyman loss V(pi_t)-V(pi*), pinning the SHARP minimax Neyman-regret rate (accumulated variance-inefficiency of the adaptive Horvitz-Thompson ATE estimator vs the oracle Neyman allocation pi*=S1/(S0+S1)); exact overlap dependence determined by the lower-bound proof, not fixed in advance. Distinct from simple-regret/best-arm minimax (arXiv:2309.08808, 2512.08513) which concern chosen-arm welfare, not estimator variance-suboptimality.

**Novelty target.** flagship

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** PASS

**Banking reason.** Certified core banked (gate-free, sorry-free, axiom-clean: kappa_nu closed form, neyman_gap_identity, recursion-to-Omega(log T) engine, derived band continuity, class/score construction); full Omega(log T) converse kept as CONDITIONAL extension on the broad LocalNeighborhoodRiskInputs gate (F2.5 flagged it as laundering the note's derived recursion/domination/sup), documented not certified.
