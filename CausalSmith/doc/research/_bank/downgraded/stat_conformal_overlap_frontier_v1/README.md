    specialization of the randomized coverage--length gaming pathology already
    attributed to Min--Lu--Li--Zhang--Teng; with a self-defined chance loss and
    a constructed SR-infinity witness, it is a useful diagnostic but does not
    yet establish the field-level frontier advance required by the injected
    floor.
  - >-
    thm:population-length-frontier-degeneracy: The order-one obstruction is
    carefully scoped and usable, but it is an existential support-rich
    counterexample under the newly introduced SR-infinity condition rather than
    a comparison theorem that separates the closest robust-conformal or
    length-optimization result class; it supports a subfield diagnostic, not
    the required field positioning.

proof_attempt_summary: |
  The run attempted a matched n^{-rho} excess-length frontier for learned
  stochastic-intervention weighted conformal prediction under a heavy
  density-ratio tail. Exact distribution-free coverage with learned weights and
  the proposed rate/converse did not survive scrutiny; the maximized sound
  replacement proves a normalized finite-list CDF envelope, an SR-infinity
  support-rich order-one connected-length obstruction, and eventual exact-zero
  marginal high-probability regret via randomized repair. D0 and the independent
  math panel passed, but D0.5 found these results below the requested field
  novelty floor; a field-tier continuation needs a new risk/validity criterion,
  stronger quantile structure, list-learning/identification assumptions, or new
  comparison theory.

# stat_conformal_overlap_frontier / v1 — Downgraded

**Topic.** Matched minimax EXCESS-LENGTH rate for distribution-free (conformal) coverage of a stochastic-intervention (modified-treatment-policy / incremental) potential outcome Y^g in [0,1] under a heavy density-ratio tail, regime gamma0 in (1,2). Weighted-conformal weight w=g/pi (density ratio, E[w|X]=1), overlap = the density-ratio tail P(w>u)<=C u^{-gamma0} so E[w^2]=inf. Over class W(gamma0,s,beta) [GPS sup-rate n^{-s/(2s+d)}, outcome regression beta-Holder], the minimax high-probability excess length over the oracle weighted-conformal interval of connected, training-conditionally-(1-alpha)-valid distribution-free intervals is ≍ n^{-rho}, with rho(gamma0,s,beta)=(gamma0-1)*min{a,1/gamma0}, a=s/(2s+d)+beta/(2beta+d): (UPPER) a tail-aware cross-fit DOUBLY-ROBUST-ORTHOGONAL clipped-WCP (clip w at 1/b_n, b_n=n^{-min{a,1/gamma0}}, Neyman-orthogonal conformity score) is training-conditionally valid with high-probability excess length <= n^{-rho}; (LOWER, the core) a Le Cam two-point construction differing only in the thin-overlap heavy-w region forces excess length >= n^{-rho}. Named objects: the conformal excess-length exponent rho and its linear (gamma0-1) density-ratio-tail dependence. The finite-sample distribution-free companion to Dorn arXiv:2504.13273; differs from Yang-Kuchibhotla-Tchetgen 2024 (asymptotic/generic), Verhaeghe 2409.20412 / Schroder 2407.03094 (WCP method, imported coverage, no rate/exponent/converse), and Diaz-Hejazi/Kennedy (asymptotic efficient estimation, no distribution-free coverage).

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** D0.5: TERMINAL-BELOW-FIELD — faithfulness and mathematics pass, but the fixed-list sample degeneracy and existential SR_infinity population obstruction do not meet the requested field novelty floor.

## Notes

The banked result is sound and useful as a negative diagnostic. Future projects
should reuse its finite-list envelope and counterexamples, but should not
re-propose the learned-weight matched exponent under the same marginal-validity
and symmetric-margin kernel.
