topic: "Coupling dichotomy and sharp non-rectangular identified set for offline contextual-bandit policy value V(pi) under JOINT misspecification: a propensity Marginal-Sensitivity-Model budget Gamma together with a structural epsilon-tube (fixed center law F0, fixed metric, stated support regularity) on the conditional potential-outcome law that the MSM clips. Prove the dichotomy: an additive tube on the conditional-outcome MEAN decouples (joint set = rectangular product, trivial), while a tube on the conditional QUANTILE function couples with the active MSM clip (joint set strictly inside the rectangular product). Deliver the closed-form sharp coupled endpoint, the non-rectangularity gap Delta_rect(Gamma,epsilon)>=0 and its positive region, and a Neyman-orthogonal efficient one-step EIF estimator with uniform inference that corrects the rectangular widening of the Frauen et al. (arXiv:2502.13022, ICLR 2026) sharp off-policy estimator V-hat^{+,*}; separate endpoint sharpness from EIF regularity away from the coupling-threshold kink."

  Field-tier coupled MSM-Gamma x quantile-tube-epsilon partial-ID. The identification
  core is fully proved and sound: the decouple/couple dichotomy (mean-tube rectangular
  vs quantile-tube coupled), the sharp coupled endpoint with its iff-equality criterion
  (narrowed at D0 from a false pointwise-envelope condition to "some MSM mean-maximizing
  law is jointly tube-feasible"), and the non-rectangularity gap Delta_rect>=0 with exact
  iff-zero. The estimation rung's FIRST-ORDER half also discharged after an insight-rich
  orchestrator directive: phi_cpl=phi_MSM-phi_tube with phi_tube the Firpo contact-face
  correction, and Neyman-orthogonality DERIVED via the contact first-order condition
  (centered contact score conditionally mean-zero under the latent optimizing law). What
  remained genuinely undischarged across TWO D0.5 escalations: (i) plug-in consistency of
  Chat_a_plus = uniform/argmax convergence over the constrained feasible class (bespoke
  empirical-process work), and (ii) registering the baseline MSM EIF (Frauen Thm 4.4) as
  an accepted substrate gate under the strict typed D0 gate (which demands every final
  node status=proved and forbids honestly scoping the inference claim). RETRY path: supply
  the uniform feasible-class consistency as a proper lemma (M-estimation/Glivenko-Cantelli
  over the MSM-cap-tube class) + a working typed-gate substrate-gate registration for the
  classical baseline EIF; the identification core + the orthogonality half lift directly.

# pid_offline_policy_joint_misspec / v2 — Downgraded

**Topic.** Coupling dichotomy and sharp non-rectangular identified set for offline contextual-bandit policy value V(pi) under JOINT misspecification: a propensity Marginal-Sensitivity-Model budget Gamma together with a structural epsilon-tube (fixed center law F0, fixed metric, stated support regularity) on the conditional potential-outcome law that the MSM clips. Prove the dichotomy: an additive tube on the conditional-outcome MEAN decouples (joint set = rectangular product, trivial), while a tube on the conditional QUANTILE function couples with the active MSM clip (joint set strictly inside the rectangular product). Deliver the closed-form sharp coupled endpoint, the non-rectangularity gap Delta_rect(Gamma,epsilon)>=0 and its positive region, and a Neyman-orthogonal efficient one-step EIF estimator with uniform inference that corrects the rectangular widening of the Frauen et al. (arXiv:2502.13022, ICLR 2026) sharp off-policy estimator V-hat^{+,*}; separate endpoint sharpness from EIF regularity away from the coupling-threshold kink.

**Novelty target.** field

**Stage -0.5 verdict.** ACCEPT

**Stage 0.5 verdict.** NA

**Banking reason.** Identification core sound and field-novel (decouple/couple dichotomy: thm:mean-decoupling rectangular mean-tube vs thm:quantile-coupled-endpoint sharp coupled quantile-tube endpoint; prop:rect-gap non-rectangularity gap Delta_rect>=0 with exact iff-zero), and the EIF decomposition phi_cpl=phi_MSM-phi_tube with contact-condition Neyman-orthogonality (centered contact score mean-zero under the latent optimizing law) DERIVED; but D0.5 twice escalated because the semiparametric inference rung's plug-in consistency (uniform feasible-class / argmax convergence) and the substrate-gate registration of the baseline MSM EIF remain genuinely undischarged under the strict typed D0 gate.
