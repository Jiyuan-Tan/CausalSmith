# Finite-design Slutsky/CDF transfer helper (re-export)

The generic CDF-level converging-together step `finiteDesign_cdf_converging_together` was promoted to
`Causalean.Experimentation.DesignBased.Slutsky`. This file re-exports it so the bipartite experiment
sees it under the `Causalean.Experimentation.DesignBased` namespace it already opens.
