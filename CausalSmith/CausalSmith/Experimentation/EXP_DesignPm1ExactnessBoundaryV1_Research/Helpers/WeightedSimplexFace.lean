/-! # The κ = 0 exposed face

At `κ = 0` the objective `wsObj α β 0` is the linear functional `Σ αᵢ tᵢ`, whose
minimizers over `Δ_M` are exactly the exposed `α`-minimizing face `exposedMinFace`. -/

/-- **The `κ = 0` minimizer set is the exposed `α`-minimizing face.** For [a simplex budget
`M`](hyp:M), [a linear weight vector `α`](hyp:α), and [a candidate point `t`](hyp:t), [`t` lies
in the simplex of budget `M` and minimizes the linear objective `Σᵢ αᵢtᵢ` over that simplex if
and only if `t` belongs to the exposed `α`-minimizing face of the simplex](goal).

Proof plan: pick `k` with `α k = min_j α j` (`Finite.exists_min`). Write
`m₀ = α k`.
* (→) If `t` minimizes, testing against the vertex `M • eₖ ∈ Δ_M` (value `M·m₀`) gives
  `Σ αᵢ tᵢ ≤ M m₀ = Σ m₀ tᵢ`, so `Σ (αᵢ − m₀) tᵢ ≤ 0`; but every summand is `≥ 0`
  (`αᵢ ≥ m₀`, `tᵢ ≥ 0`), forcing each `(αᵢ − m₀) tᵢ = 0`. Hence `tᵢ ≠ 0 ⇒ αᵢ = m₀ ≤ αⱼ`.
* (←) If `t ∈ exposedMinFace`, then `Σ αᵢ tᵢ = Σ m₀ tᵢ = M m₀` (each nonzero coord has
  `αᵢ = m₀`), and for any `s ∈ Δ_M`, `Σ αⱼ sⱼ ≥ Σ m₀ sⱼ = M m₀`. -/
