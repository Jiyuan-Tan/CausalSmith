/-! # Weighted Cauchy–Schwarz on the three-point simplex

Cauchy–Schwarz for the weighted inner product `⟨s,t⟩_β = Σ βᵢ sᵢ tᵢ` on a finite index type,
in the squared form `weighted_cs_sq` and the strict simplex-slice form
`weighted_cs_simplex_strict`.  The strict version is used to prove uniqueness for
the weighted-simplex SOCP: on the affine slice `Σ sᵢ = Σ tᵢ = M > 0`, distinct
points are not positive scalar multiples of each other, so equality in
Cauchy–Schwarz cannot occur.

The squared form is the arbitrary-finite-index
`Causalean.Mathlib.Analysis.weighted_inner_sq_le`; only the strict version is genuinely
three-dimensional (its proof uses the explicit Lagrange identity). -/

/-- **Weighted Cauchy–Schwarz (squared form).** For [finitely many coordinates weighted
by nonnegative masses β](hyp:hβ), [the square of the weighted inner product
$\sum \beta_i s_i t_i$ of two vectors $s$ and $t$ is at most the product of their
weighted sums of squares $(\sum \beta_i s_i^2)(\sum \beta_i t_i^2)$](goal).

This is the general finite-index form of
`Causalean.Mathlib.Analysis.weighted_inner_sq_le`. -/

/-- **Strict weighted Cauchy–Schwarz on the simplex slice.** For [a nonzero total mass
M](hyp:hM) and [positive coordinate weights β](hyp:hβ), if [the coordinates of $s$ sum to
$M$](hyp:hs), [the coordinates of $t$ sum to $M$](hyp:ht), and [$s$ and $t$ are distinct
vectors](hyp:hne), then [the weighted inner product $\sum \beta_i s_i t_i$ is strictly
less than the product of the weighted Euclidean norms $\sqrt{\sum \beta_i s_i^2} \cdot
\sqrt{\sum \beta_i t_i^2}$](goal).

Proof plan:
* Let `P = Σ βᵢ sᵢ²`, `Q = Σ βᵢ tᵢ²`, `R = Σ βᵢ sᵢ tᵢ`. Since `t ≠ 0` (its coords
  sum to a nonzero `M`) and `β > 0`, `Q > 0`; likewise `P > 0`, so `√P·√Q = √(P·Q) > 0`.
* Show `R² < P·Q`. The Lagrange gap `P·Q − R²` equals
  `β0β1(s0t1−s1t0)² + β0β2(s0t2−s2t0)² + β1β2(s1t2−s2t1)² ≥ 0`. If it were `0` then all
  three cross terms vanish; with `t ≠ 0` this forces `s = c • t` for `c = sₖ/tₖ` at any
  `tₖ ≠ 0`, and then `M = Σ sᵢ = c Σ tᵢ = c M` gives `c = 1`, i.e. `s = t`,
  contradicting `s ≠ t`. Hence the gap is `> 0`.
* Conclude `R ≤ √(R²) < √(P·Q) = √P·√Q` (if `R < 0` it is `< 0 < √P·√Q` directly). -/
