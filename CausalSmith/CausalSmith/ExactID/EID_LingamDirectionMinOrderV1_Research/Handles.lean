# Worked compatibility instances and construction / atlas handles

Statable set / certificate / incidence pieces used by the deferred conjectures.
The external decision-procedure content — the sign-invariant CAD stratification
of `\bar E_m(ℝ)` (interface `I-3`) and the truncated-moment-problem atomic
representation (interface `I-4`) — is NOT built here; these `def`s supply only
the project's own statable reductions.

/-- Worked compatibility incidence systems `A_m` — the explicit **complex**
full-fiber incidence equations at the two worked cases `m = 1` (`K = 4`, the
12-equation system `A_1`) and `m = 2` (`K = 6`, the 25-equation system `A_2`).  A
pair `(θ, η)` of **complex** loading-and-cumulant lists is in the system iff its
forward and reverse simultaneous binary-form decompositions agree at every
retained coordinate `(r, a)` through order `K = 2m + 2` — the 12 scalar equations
`t_{r,a} = c_{0r}γ^a + c_{1r}ρ^a + c_{2r}1{a=r} = d_{0r}1{a=0} + d_{1r}σ^{r-a}
+ d_{2r}δ^{r-a}` for `m = 1`, and the analogous 25 for `m = 2` — **and** at least one
of the two generic-locus inequations holds (`θ ∈ Θ^{right,∘}` or `η ∈ Θ^{left,∘}`),
matching the paper's generic-locus disjunction.  These are the explicit complex
incidence equations the note requests (not a real-image complexification).  The
stated common-axis subfamily is `workedCompatibilityCommonAxis` below, which is a
subset of this system (recorded in `oeq:generic-exceptional-locus`).

Both members of the pair are pinned to the paper's finite ambient
`Θ^{right}_{m,K} × Θ^{left}_{m,K}` via `bandSupportedParams`.  The generic-locus
disjunction band-pins only *whichever* member satisfies it, so without these two
explicit conjuncts the other member's off-band source weights would stay free and
`A_m` would be a *cylinder* over them — exactly the restriction already imposed on
`genericFullFiberCompatibility` and `genericCompatibilityPreimage`. -/

/-- Common-axis subfamily of the worked incidence systems `A_m` (`m ∈ {1, 2}`).
Shared across both worked cases: the first latent slope vanishes on both arrows
(`ρ_1 = 0`, `σ_1 = 0`, read off the loading families at the first middle index),
the direct edges are reciprocal (`δγ = 1`), and the weight relations
`d_{0r} = c_{1r}`, `d_{1r} = c_{m+1,r}`, `d_{m+1,r} = c_{0r}γ^r` hold on the
retained band (for `m = 1` these are `d_{1r} = c_{2r}`, for `m = 2`
`d_{1r} = c_{3r}`; the `m = 2`-only relations `σ₂ρ₂ = 1`, `d_{2r} = c_{2r}ρ₂^r`
specialise the same pattern). -/

/-- **Worked compatibility systems** `A_m` (`m ∈ {1, 2}`) — the full object the
paper's `def:worked-compatibility-instances` defines, bundled so the extracted
definition carries *both* the explicit incidence system and its common-axis
subfamily with all its explicit parameter relations (not only the incidence
equations):

* `.1` = `workedCompatibilityInstances m`, the 12-equation `A_1` (`m = 1`, `K = 4`) /
  25-equation `A_2` (`m = 2`, `K = 6`) incidence systems with the generic-locus
  disjunction;
* `.2` = the common-axis **subfamily of the worked incidence system**,
  `workedCompatibilityCommonAxis m ∩ workedCompatibilityInstances m`: the paper's
  explicit common-axis relations (`ρ₁ = σ₁ = 0`, `δγ = 1`, the `d_{jr}` weight
  relations, and for `m = 2` additionally `σ₂ρ₂ = 1`, `d_{2r} = c_{2r}ρ₂^r`)
  **intersected with `A_m`**, so that `.2 ⊆ .1` holds definitionally.  The bare
  common-axis predicate `workedCompatibilityCommonAxis` admits zero-weight points
  lying in neither generic locus and hence outside `A_m`; intersecting with the
  incidence system restricts it to an actual subfamily of `A_m`, as the paper states.

/-- Compactly-supported real feasible region: like `realFeasibleRegion` but each
source law is additionally required to be **compactly supported** (supported in a
bounded set).  This is strictly stronger than `realFeasibleRegion`, which allows
arbitrary realizing non-Gaussian laws.

*On the note's "truncated-moment-matrix perturbation".*  The note reaches this region by a
perturbation of a positive compactly-supported density.  That is the note's **method of exhibiting**
the realizing laws, not a property of the laws it exhibits: "was obtained by a perturbation" is not
a predicate on a measure, so it is not — and must not be — a conjunct here.  Adding one would make
the Lean predicate *strictly stronger* than the object the note defines.  The perturbation content the
development actually uses is a **proved theorem**, not an assumed clause: `truncatedMomentInterior`
(`Causalean.Stat.MomentProblems.truncatedMomentInterior`, fully proved) supplies exactly the
moment-cone-interior /
neighbourhood-realizability fact for which the perturbation is invoked. -/

nonzero direct slope and pairwise-distinct finite slopes, and `Q_K` is the finite
atomic (Hankel-PSD) certificate on each source cumulant list.  The reverse mirror
is `realAtlasHandleReverse`.  The simultaneous sign-invariant CAD stratification

`ℝ^{q_K} × Θ^b_{m,K}`: the band memberships of `t` and `lam` are conjoined on the
right-hand side, exactly as `IsSemialgebraicCumCell` already does for observable cells.
This is forced, not cosmetic.  `realAtlasHandle` pins *infinitely* many off-band
coordinates of `t` and `lam` to `0`, whereas a `Finset` of polynomials constrains only
*finitely* many variables; an unguarded biconditional would therefore be unsatisfiable,

witnesses first, then `λ`, then the observable base `t`.  The Lean CAD recursion
peels and erases the **head** of this list, so this is the typed orientation of the

many `(r, a)` coordinates; a finite union of such cylinders can never equal

/-- The paper-specific **effective/evaluable** real exceptional atlas output.

Besides the raw full `(t, lambda, w, z)` construction, this record exposes the
post-elimination `(t, lambda)` cells themselves.  Their direct lambda sections —
not existential projections left in witness space — are exactly the complete
forward and reverse feasible fibers, including singular, nongeneric, and boundary
branches.  Effectivity is finite symbolic data: explicit polynomial families and
orders, an exhaustive finite sign-oracle lookup table, and a certified construction
trace with a displayed doubly-exponential operation bound.  The lookup tests are
the displayed CAD decision family, not merely the exceptional-closure equations:
they include the observable real/imaginary equations and every observable
coefficient, discriminant, principal subresultant, and retained-cell sign
polynomial carried by the real projection/retention trace.

The record is deliberately separate from `realAtlasHandleOutput`: the latter is
only the cited, paper-agnostic classical CAD theorem.  Producing this record is the
paper-specific conclusion of `exactRealExceptionalAtlas`. -/

/-- The **output shape** of the paper's atlas handle at complexity `m`: the engine returns a
value of `RealAtlasCADData m`.  This is a *definition of what the handle emits*, not an
assertion that it exists.  It is retained as an unasserted name for the weaker raw-CAD output
shape.  The proved paper-specific theorem concludes the strictly richer
`Nonempty (EffectiveRealAtlasOutput m)`, which also carries finite sign-table evaluators and
their exactness certificates. -/

/-- **Real exceptional-locus atlas handle — the CITED external interface** (`I-3`).

The note's `def:real-atlas-handle` opens by saying what it is: *"External (cited) interface,
not proved here.  The handle's correctness … is the classical real quantifier-elimination and
truncated-moment theory (Tarski–Seidenberg).  It is INVOKED as a cited external interface and
is not reproved in this note."*  This declaration is the Lean rendering of that cited interface,
and it therefore states the **theorem of record itself**: `RealClosedFieldCADInterface`
(`Helpers/CAD/CADInterface.lean`) — the cylindrical algebraic decomposition adapted to an
**arbitrary** finite family of real polynomials in an **arbitrary** number of variables, together
with the Tarski–Seidenberg projection theorem.  Both conjuncts are universally quantified and
self-contained; neither mentions this paper's objects.

*Source of record* (`cite:bcr-bpr-cad`): Bochnak–Coste–Roy, *Real Algebraic Geometry*, §2.3 and
Thm 2.2.1; Basu–Pollack–Roy, *Algorithms in Real Algebraic Geometry*, Ch. 5 (Thm 5.6, Def. 5.1,
Def. 5.5, Notation 5.15, Thm 5.16).  The node was previously sourced to Collins (1975); that is an
**algorithm** paper, whose statement of record carries effectivity/complexity content this `Prop`
does not encode.  Nothing in this development consumes CAD effectivity — we assume only the
existence and structure of a sign-invariant cell decomposition — so the mathematical theorem is the
correct source, and the `Prop` itself is unchanged.

It deliberately does **not** assert `Nonempty (RealAtlasCADData m)`.  That proposition is part of
our bespoke conclusion — the atlas the engine would emit for *our* incidence system — and asserting
it under the CAD citation would smuggle unproved paper-specific content (the elimination-ideal
generators of `\bar E_m`, the `Q_K` ⟺ real-source-feasibility equivalence, and the cellwise
witness elimination) in behind a citation that supplies none of it.  The decomposition theorem is
the *tool*; the effective atlas is the derived conclusion `exactRealExceptionalAtlas`.

The handle's *construction* — the two incidence sets `Γ_right`/`Γ_left` (`realAtlasHandle`,
`realAtlasHandleReverse`), the atomic certificate `Q_K`, the projection family, the cell
language and the atlas output record `RealAtlasCADData` — is rendered by the declarations above.
The cited engine is what would be *run* on that construction; its correctness is what is
borrowed here.  Its shared lifting language ignores a stage polynomial whenever its specialization
at the current base point is identically zero in the lifting variable; this is the standard CAD
nullification convention and prevents a nullified polynomial from creating an infinite root stack.
Nothing on the critical path of `thm:generic-apolar-arrow-recovery` depends on this interface: the
flagship is unconditional. -/
