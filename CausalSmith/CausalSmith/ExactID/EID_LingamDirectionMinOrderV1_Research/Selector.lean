# The global feasible-fiber decision formula, direction selector, separated
# model domain, and generic real information order

Statable population-level constructions.  The finite/evaluable *decision
procedure* content — the claim that `FeasFiber^b` and the selector `S_m` are
decidable by real quantifier elimination / sign-invariant cylindrical algebraic
decomposition — is the external interface `I-3` and is NOT encoded here: the
`def`s realize only the existential real Props and the two-branch relation.  The
atomic-witness ↔ real-source-realizability equivalence rests on the external
truncated Hamburger interface `I-4`.

/-- Global feasible-fiber **feasibility formula** `FeasFiber^b_m(t)` at order
`K = 2m + 2` (the existential-atomic-feasibility component of the bundled
`def:global-feasible-fiber-decision`, `feasibleFiberDecision` below).  Its truth
value is **exactly** the nonemptiness of
`R^b_{m,K}(t) ∩ F^b_{m,K}`: there exist `b`-loading and source-cumulant
coordinates `λ` that are real moment-feasible (`λ ∈ F^b_{m,K}`, which already
carries the nonzero direct slope, the pairwise-distinct finite slopes, the
finite-band cumulant coordinates, and the real non-Gaussian source realizability
whose finite atomic `Q_K` reformulation is interface `I-4`) with `Φ^b(λ) = t`.
By construction this def **is** the exact feasible-fiber equivalence; the atomic
`Q_K` reformulation is `atomicCertificate` below.

Deciding this formula — the real-QE / sign-invariant-CAD decision procedure with
the prescribed variable order `t, λ`, then witnesses, and the apolar rank-open
support-annihilator implementation — is the external interface `I-3`/`I-1` and is
NOT encoded here; only the existential feasibility Prop is realized.

Faithful to the paper's definition, the formula encodes the **atomic witnesses**
explicitly: there exist `b`-loading and source-cumulant coordinates `λ` with
`Φ^b(λ) = t`, nonzero direct slope, pairwise-distinct finite loading slopes, and,
for each source `j`, a finite atomic (Hankel-PSD) certificate `Q_K` on its cumulant
list — `atomicCertificate` — asserting `Σ_h w_{jh} = 1`, `w_{jh} ≥ 0`,
`Σ_h w_{jh} z_{jh}^r = μ_{jr}` for `1 ≤ r ≤ K` with `μ_{jr} = B_r(0, k_{j2}, …)`,
and `μ_{j2} > 0`.  Its equivalence with real non-Gaussian finite-`K` source
realizability (hence with `R^b_{m,K}(t) ∩ F^b_{m,K} ≠ ∅`) is the external truncated
Hamburger interface `I-4`.

/-- A stacked cumulant vector is **band-supported** when it vanishes off the retained

records.  Every cumulant map `Φ^b_{m,2m+2}` lands here (it is defined to be `0` off the
band), so this is exactly the observable coordinate space the paper's decision procedure
ranges over.

Restricting the decision interfaces below to band-supported `t` is what makes them
SATISFIABLE, and it is faithful to the paper: a finite semialgebraic sign table reads
finitely many coordinates, so it can never certify the equation `Φ λ = t` at the
infinitely many out-of-band coordinates — an unrestricted `∀ t` iff would be vacuously
unsatisfiable and would silently collapse the decision Prop to `False`. -/

/-! #### The apolar route: divided-power blocks and their contractions

The note defines the arrow decision on the rank-open locus by *"factoring the recovered degree-`n`
support annihilator `Q_D` **from the contractions of the divided-power forms `f_{n+k}`**"*
(`def:global-feasible-fiber-decision`; `writeup.tex` §thm:generic-apolar-arrow-recovery).  `Q_D` is
therefore not just *some* squarefree product over a recovered support — it is *the generator of the
common contraction kernel*.  These three primitives let the certificate say exactly that, so the
definition carries the note's own characterization of `Q_D` rather than a downstream consequence of
it.  (They mirror `dividedPowerBlock` / `diffApply` / `supportAnnihilator` of
`Helpers/ApolarDefs.lean`, which are stated over `ℂ`; the certificate lives over `ℝ`.) -/

/-- Real divided-power binary form of the order-`r` cumulant block:
`f_r(x, y) = Σ_{a=0}^r C(r,a) t_{r,a} x^{r-a} y^a` (with `x = X 0`, `y = X 1`). -/

/-- The squarefree degree-`n` support annihilator `Q_D = ∏_{ℓ ∈ D} ℓ^⊥` as a real binary form, in
the same sign convention as the evaluation-form product used by the certificate below. -/
noncomputable def realSupportAnnihilatorPoly {m : ℕ} (support : Fin (m + 2) → ℝ × ℝ) :
    MvPolynomial (Fin 2) ℝ :=

      MvPolynomial.C (support j).2 * MvPolynomial.X 0)

/-- The recovered squarefree support-annihilator certificate on the apolar
rank-open locus.  `Q_D` is characterized exactly as the note characterizes it — as the generator of
the **common kernel of the contractions** `q ↦ (q(∂) f_{n+k})_{0 ≤ k ≤ n-2}` of the divided-power
blocks, `n = m + 2` — and it is then factored into the `m+2` support directions, from which the
decision is read off membership of the arrow's fixed axis.

The `annihilator`/`kernel` conjuncts are what make this *the apolar* certificate: without them the
predicate would record only that *some* unique block-explaining support exists and that its product
form is the annihilator, which is a consequence of the note's contraction-kernel identity rather
than the identity itself. -/

/-- **Global feasible-fiber decision** `FeasFiber^b_m` — the full object the paper's
`def:global-feasible-fiber-decision` defines, bundled as a **pair** so the extracted
definition carries *both* the existential atomic feasibility formula **and** the paper's
operational decision structure (not only the existential Prop, which alone under-records
the paper):

* `.1` = the per-`t` **existential atomic feasibility formula**
  `feasibleFiberFormula m (Φ^b)` — the statable population predicate whose truth value at
  `t` is exactly `R^b_{m,K}(t) ∩ F^b_{m,K} ≠ ∅`;
* `.2` = the paper-defined **operational decision structure**
  `feasibleFiberDecisionInterfaces m b (Φ^b)` — the real-QE / sign-invariant-CAD decision
  with the prescribed variable order (`t, λ`, then the atomic witnesses) (`I-3`) and the
  apolar rank-open support-annihilator direct implementation (`I-1`).  These are the two
  operational clauses the note states (anchored, external, routed to `SUBSTRATE_DEBT`; not
  encoded as executable in-run).

The arrow map is **pinned by the arrow tag**: as in the note, `Φ^b` is *determined* by `b`
(`Φ^right = forwardCumulantMap`, `Φ^left = reverseCumulantMap`, i.e.
`directionCumulantMap m b`).  It is deliberately NOT an independent parameter: exposing a
free `Φ` would let the decision be read off an arrow map unrelated to the arrow tag `b`
whose fixed axis the apolar certificate consults.

The two components are held SEPARATELY, exactly as `directionSelectorWithDecision` holds
the selector map and its decision interfaces.  Conjoining the `t`-independent operational
structure *into* the per-`t` Prop (an earlier rendering) was unsound: it made
`FeasFiber^b_m(t)` entail the global existence of a finite semialgebraic decision, which
is unsatisfiable against an unrestricted `∀ t` iff, collapsing the predicate to `False`
instead of "true exactly when `R^b_{m,K}(t) ∩ F^b_{m,K} ≠ ∅`".
