# The cited external interface: cylindrical algebraic decomposition adapted to a finite
# polynomial family, and Tarski–Seidenberg real quantifier elimination

This file **states** — it never proves — the classical external theory the note CITES.  Everything
here is a statement about an **arbitrary** finite family of real polynomials in an **arbitrary**
number of variables: nothing in this file mentions this paper's cumulants, parameters, incidence
sets, or exceptional locus.

That generality is the whole point.  A `cited` node is a *borrowed classical fact*, so its Lean
proposition must encode the **theorem of record**, not a bespoke existence claim about the objects
we happen to want.  Tailoring the cited statement to this paper's objects would make the
source-match vacuously true while smuggling in unproved content — the failure mode the source-match
gate exists to catch.

## Source of record (`cite:bcr-bpr-cad`)

The fact assumed here is the **mathematical** cell-decomposition theorem, *not* a decision
procedure:

* **Bochnak–Coste–Roy**, *Real Algebraic Geometry* (Ergebnisse 36, 1998), §2.3 "Decomposition of
  Semi-algebraic Sets" (the cylindrical sign-invariant decomposition) and **Thm 2.2.1**
  (Tarski–Seidenberg / projection).
* **Basu–Pollack–Roy**, *Algorithms in Real Algebraic Geometry*, **Ch. 5** — Def. 5.1 (cylindrical
  decomposition; section/sector cells), Def. 5.5 (`P`-invariance, "cad *adapted to* `P`"),
  **Thm 5.6** ("for every finite set `P` of polynomials in `R[X₁,…,X_k]` there is a cylindrical
  decomposition of `R^k` adapted to `P`"), Notation 5.15 (the `Elim` projection operator) and
  Thm 5.16 (lifting over an `Elim`-invariant cell).  BPR Ch. 5 is *mathematics*; the algorithms
  live in BPR Ch. 11 and are **not** cited.

This node was previously sourced to Collins (1975).  That was the wrong source of record: Collins'
paper is an **algorithm** (a decision procedure with a computing-time bound), so its statement
carries effectivity/computability content that this `Prop` does not encode — and must not, since
nothing in this development consumes CAD effectivity (we assume only the *existence and structure*
of a sign-invariant cell decomposition).  The BCR/BPR theorems state exactly the existence +
structure fact that is used.

## The statement of record, and how it is encoded

* **Adapted decomposition (existence + sign-invariance).**  For every dimension, every finite family
  `A` and every variable order, a finite cylindrical decomposition into semialgebraic cells exists,
  and every member of `A` has constant sign on every cell (BPR Thm 5.6 + Def. 5.5).
* **Projection family.**  Sign-invariance holds not merely for `A` but for the family the projection
  operator *generates* from `A` — the successive nonzero truncations/reducta, their coefficients and
  discriminants, and their derivative/pair principal subresultants, iterated down the variable order
  (`generatedCADProjectionFamily`; BPR Notation 5.15 + Thm 5.16).
* **Section / sector lifting.**  Every cell is a *recursively lifted* section/sector cell of that
  generated family: at each variable it is the graph of an indexed continuous real-algebraic root
  function, or a sector below the first root, between two consecutive roots, or above the last
  (`IsRecursivelyLiftedCADCell`; BPR Def. 5.1 + Thm 5.16).
* **Decision (set-theoretic) / quantifier elimination.**  Every polynomial sign condition built from
  `A` is decided by the cell a point lies in — each cell is contained in, or disjoint from, the
  condition's solution set (BPR Def. 5.5: a cad adapted to `P` is adapted to every `P`-semialgebraic
  set) — and the projection of a semialgebraic set is semialgebraic (Tarski–Seidenberg).  This is
  *decision by the cells*, a statement about `ℝ^r`; it is **not** a claim that the cells are
  computable.

## Two normalizations, disclosed (neither strengthens the cited content)

1. **Variable order.**  The printed theorems fix the order `X₁,…,X_k` and eliminate `X_k` first.  The
   arbitrary-order form quantified over below is the immediate corollary obtained by *relabelling
   coordinates*, which is why it is stated that way here.
2. **Discriminants.**  BPR's `Elim` lists the principal subresultant coefficients of `(R, ∂R/∂X_k)`
   together with `lcof(R)`; the discriminant is `sRes₀(R, ∂R/∂X_k)` divided by `lcof(R)` up to sign.
   So sign-invariance for BPR's generated family already *implies* sign-invariance for the
   discriminant family named here: including discriminants (the Collins / Arnon–Collins–McCallum
   phrasing of the same operator) demands nothing beyond BPR's `Elim`.

Everything the statements use is defined here, so the interface is self-contained: no free abstract
variable, no class named only in prose.

/-! ### The projection phase

The projection operator (BPR Notation 5.15, `Elim`): regard each polynomial as univariate in the
lifting variable, form all of its successive nonzero reducta by deleting the current leading term,
and adjoin the coefficients and discriminant of every reductum together with the principal
subresultants of every reductum against its derivative and of every pair of reducta.  Iterating down
the variable order produces the projection family the decomposition is built from.  These operators
are stated for an arbitrary coordinate index type `σ`; the cited theorem instantiates them at
`σ = Fin r`, and this paper's atlas (`Handles.lean`) instantiates the same operators at its own
incidence coordinates. -/

/-- **Recursive cylindrical section/sector geometry** in the declared variable order — the output of
the section/sector lifting of BPR Def. 5.1 + Thm 5.16.  Over a cell of the base decomposition the
polynomials of the *stage* family have finitely many real roots `ξ_1 < … < ξ_ℓ` in the lifting
coordinate, and the cells above it are exactly: the whole fibre when `ℓ = 0`; otherwise the graph of
an indexed root (a *section*), the sector below the first root, a sector between two consecutive
indexed roots, or the sector above the last root.

Two things are load-bearing here, and both were wrong in an earlier encoding (which made this `Prop`
*unsatisfiable*, hence the cited statement `False`):

* **The family is stage-specific.**  It is threaded through the recursion and *projected* (via
  `cadProjectionStep`) on each descent, exactly as BPR's `C_i(A) = Elim_{X_{i+1}}(C_{i+1}(A))`: roots
  in the lifting coordinate `x` are roots of the family that still involves `x`, while the base is
  decomposed by the family with `x` eliminated.  Passing one fully projected family at every stage is
  not the cited theorem.
* **The `ℓ = 0` cell exists.**  When the stage family has no real root over the base, the cited
  decomposition puts a single cell — the entire fibre — above it.  Omitting this case is what made
  the statement false at, e.g., `r = 1`, `A = ∅`, where the theorem plainly supplies the cell `ℝ`. -/

/-- Project onto the coordinates still **live** at a given depth of the lifting order: every
coordinate outside `live` is zeroed.

This is the projection the cited decomposition is cylindrical over, and it must be read off `order`,
not off the natural index numbering.  `IsRecursivelyLiftedCADCell` peels the **head** of the order
first and zeroes it (`cadEraseCoordinate`), so at depth `k` the base cell lives in exactly the
coordinates of `order.drop k`. -/

/-- **Cylindrical arrangement** (the cylindricity condition of BPR Def. 5.1), **relative to the
lifting order**.  At every depth `k` of the order, the projections of any two cells onto the
coordinates still live there (`order.drop k`) are either identical or disjoint — i.e. the cells are
stacked in cylinders over the cells of the induced decomposition of every stage.

The order-relativity is load-bearing.  An earlier encoding fixed cylindricity to the **natural
coordinate-index prefixes** (`cadTruncate`) while `AdaptedCADConstruction` quantifies over *every*
variable order and the recursion lifts along that order.  The two then disagree for all but one
order — and even there they name opposite coordinate sets (index prefix vs. order suffix) — so the
assumed `Prop` was false, not merely over-strong. -/

/-- **Cylindrical algebraic decomposition adapted to a finite polynomial family** — BPR Thm 5.6
(with Def. 5.1, Def. 5.5, Notation 5.15, Thm 5.16); BCR §2.3.

*Statement of record.*  For **any** number of variables `r`, **any** finite family `A` of real
polynomials in `r` variables, and **any** variable order, `ℝ^r` admits a cylindrical algebraic
decomposition adapted to `A`: finitely many nonempty, pairwise disjoint, cylindrically arranged
semialgebraic cells, obtained by recursive section/sector lifting of the generated projection family
(coefficients, discriminants, principal subresultants), on each of which every member of `A` and of
that projection family has constant sign — so that every sign condition built from `A` is decided by
the cell a point lies in.

ASSUMED, not proved: CAD is absent from Mathlib.  This is the **mathematical** theorem (BPR Ch. 5),
not Collins' algorithm: no computability, effectivity or complexity claim is made here, and none is
consumed anywhere in this development.  The arbitrary variable order is the coordinate-relabelling
corollary of the printed fixed-order statement (see the module docstring, normalization 1); the
discriminants are already implied by BPR's `Elim` family (normalization 2). -/

/-- **Tarski–Seidenberg projection theorem** — BCR Thm 2.2.1; BPR Ch. 2 (Projection Theorem for
Semi-Algebraic Sets).

*Statement of record.*  The image of a semialgebraic subset of `ℝ^{r+1}` under the projection that
forgets the last coordinate is a semialgebraic subset of `ℝ^r`.  Equivalently: semialgebraic
conditions are closed under existential quantification, so a quantified polynomial condition is
equivalent to a quantifier-free one.

This is the *set-theoretic* projection/quantifier-elimination statement, not the effective decision
procedure.  Universally quantified over the ambient dimension and the set; ASSUMED, not proved. -/
