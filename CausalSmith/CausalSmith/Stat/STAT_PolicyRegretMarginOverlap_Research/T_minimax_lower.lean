/-- Active-block admissibility check for the overlap-decay envelope in the decaying-overlap
regime (positive `γ`).

The witness puts covariate mass `c_B h^α` on its active block, where the overlap is the
weak-arm scale `h^{β_{α,γ}}`. If the block-width constant obeys `c_B ≤ C_o c_o^{-α/γ}`,
then for every overlap level `v` between that weak-arm scale and the admissible ceiling
`c_o u^γ`, the block mass is at most the envelope value `C_o u^α v^{1/γ}`. This is
precisely the inequality that places the witness inside the assumed law class. -/

/-- Active-block admissibility check for the overlap-decay envelope in the degenerate
branch where the weak-arm exponent `β_{α,γ}` vanishes, so the witness's active block
carries the FIXED treatment probability one quarter rather than a decaying power of the
contrast height.

If the block-width constant obeys `c_B ≤ C_o 4^{-1/γ}`, then it is at most `C_o v^{1/γ}`
at every overlap level `v` of at least one quarter. In this branch the block's covariate
mass and the envelope's margin factor both degenerate to constants, so no `u^α` factor is
available to absorb the block width — which is why the constraint on `c_B` is the
stronger one. -/

/-- Each two-point witness is a well-formed observed law, for either sign `σ = ±1`.

Its data law is a probability measure whose covariate marginal is exactly the uniform law
on the unit interval; its contrast, propensity, and outcome regressions are measurable; the
contrast equals the difference of the two regressions; the propensity takes values in
`[0,1]`; and the tested conditional-mean identities that pin the propensity and the two
regressions to the data law hold. -/

-- @node: lem:witness-membership
/-- `lem:witness-membership`. For all large `n` the two witness laws belong to
`def:law-class`, and the two explicit witness-optimal policies are
`x ↦ 1` (under `P_{n,+}`) and `x ↦ 1{x ∉ B_n}` (under `P_{n,-}`); if these belong
to `Π` they are the two policy actions of the two-point reduction. The membership
is DERIVED from the construction, not assumed. -/

  The note's active-block overlap-decay verification needs exactly `hcBo`,
  `hcB_gpos`, and `hcB_gzero`: for `γ = 0` the block mass is controlled by
  `cB ≤ Co`; for `0 < γ, 0 < α` by
  `cB ≤ Co * co ^ (-(α / γ))`; and for `0 < γ, α = 0` by
  `cB ≤ Co * 4 ^ (-(1 / γ))`.

  The `OverlapDecay` window now includes the required hypothesis `u ≤ u0`.
  Since the off-block contrast is `(u0 + 2) / 2 > u0`, every admissible
  overlap-decay event is confined to the active block.  The remaining
  calculation is the active-block mass/exponent split used in the note:
  `γ=0` by `hcBo`, `γ>0, α>0` by `hcB_gpos` and
  `(α+1) * betaAG α γ / γ = α`, and `γ>0, α=0` by `hcB_gzero`.

    For `0 < u ≤ u0`, the off-block branch has contrast
    `τ0 = (u0 + 2) / 2 > u0`, so the event cannot contain off-block points.
      What remains is the active block `B_n`, with mass `cB * hLower α γ n ^ α`
      and overlap scale `qLower α γ n`.  The three note cases listed above
      discharge the bound.

/-- Three-cell χ² bound from proportional restrictions.

The cells are ordered as an off/dummy cell, a charged `Y=1` cell, and a charged
`Y=-1` cell.  If the numerator measure is a constant multiple of the denominator
on each cell, with ratios `1`, `(1+h)/(1-h)`, and `(1-h)/(1+h)`, and the
denominator charged-cell masses are `A(1-h)/2` and `A(1+h)/2`, then the
contribution is bounded by `8 * m * q * h^2` whenever `A ≤ m q` and
`0 ≤ h ≤ 1/2`. -/

/-- For all large enough sample sizes, the two members of the two-point pair are both
probability laws, the `σ = +1` law is absolutely continuous with respect to the `σ = -1`
law with square-integrable likelihood-ratio deviation, and their ONE-DRAW chi-squared
divergence is at most `8 c_B h_n^{2+α+β_{α,γ}}`.

The two laws differ only on the treated cell inside the active block, which carries
covariate mass `c_B h_n^α` and treatment probability `q_n`; the outcome laws there have
means `±h_n`, contributing a factor of order `h_n²`. Since the contrast height is calibrated
as `h_n = n^{-1/D_{α,γ}}` with `D_{α,γ} = 2+α+β_{α,γ}`, this per-draw divergence is of order
`1/n`, so the divergence of the `n`-fold product experiment stays bounded — which is what
keeps the two laws statistically indistinguishable and yields the Le Cam testing floor. -/

  Local computation needed by `two_point_divergence`: for large `n`,
  `h = hLower α γ n ≤ 1/2`, `q = qLower α γ n ∈ (0,1/2]`, and the two
  witness laws have the same `(X,A)` kernel and the same outcome kernel except
  on `{x ∈ B_n, A = true}`.  On that cell the outcome kernels are
  `bernoulliPM h` and `bernoulliPM (-h)`, so the RN ratio is the pulled-back
  Bernoulli ratio and the χ² contribution is
  `PX(B_n) * q * 4*h^2/(1-h^2) ≤ 8*cB*h^(2+α+betaAG α γ)`.

    The reusable finite-partition χ² reduction is now built above as
    `chiSqDiv_three_cell_bound_of_restrict`; the remaining substrate gap is the
    concrete restriction/mass calculation for this nested
    `Measure.bind`/`Measure.map` witness, namely the three cells
    `{¬(B_n X ∧ A)}`, `{B_n X ∧ A ∧ Y=1}`, and `{B_n X ∧ A ∧ Y=-1}`.

-- @node: lem:two-point-divergence
/-- `lem:two-point-divergence`. The per-observation χ²-divergence scales as
`χ² ≤ C h_n^{2+α+β_{α,γ}} = C h_n^{D_{α,γ}}` (i.e. `m_n q_n h_n²` with
`m_n ~ h_n^α`, `q_n ~ h_n^{β_{α,γ}}`); with `h_n = n^{-1/D_{α,γ}}` the per-draw
divergence is `≤ C/n`, so by the product identity the `n`-fold divergence is
uniformly bounded. The admissibility `8 c_B c_Q < log 5` (`c_Q = 1` for the
`qLower` weak-arm scale) keeps the product divergence below a constant. -/
