# Policy-regret rate: strict-gap tightness (OPEN residual)

Stage-2 scaffold. `oeq:feasible-tight` is the genuinely OPEN strict-gap
tightness question. Per the OEQ rule it is encoded as a named `Prop` `def`
(`FeasibleTightQuestion`) that STATES the residual — whether, in the strict-gap
branch `g_joint < r_⋆`, some genuinely feasible cross-fit estimator attains the
converse exponent `r_⋆` — WITHOUT proving it. No theorem is emitted for this
node and no downstream theorem depends on it; there is no proof and no placeholder proof.

-- @node: oeq:feasible-tight
/-- `oeq:feasible-tight` (OPEN research question — STATED, not proven).

In the strict-gap branch `g_joint < r_⋆`, the residual question is whether SOME
genuinely feasible cross-fitted-nuisance estimator — the `feasibleERM` built
from estimated nuisances `(μ̂₀, μ̂₁, ê)` that obey the bounded-truncation
(`BoundedCrossfitNuisances`), polynomial cross-fit-rate
(`PolynomialNuisanceExponents` at the same regime `(a, c, C_μ, C_prod)`), and
`L²(P)` nuisance-rate (`NuisanceRate`) conditions over the bundled
side-condition domain `dom` — attains the converse exponent `r_⋆`, i.e. whether
its conditional upper risk `upperRisk dom (feasibleERM …)` decays like
`n^{-r_⋆}` up to logarithmic factors, rather than the slower conditional
exponent `g_joint` of `oeq:feasible-upper`.

SCOPE (Lean encoding fidelity): the enumeration `enum : ℕ → Policy 𝒳` threaded
through `upperRisk` carries the note's dense-`Π₀` enumeration condition: the open
dichotomy is guarded by `DenseSkeleton enum policySet`, so the residual question is
recorded specifically for the pointwise-dense-skeleton feasible ERM of
`def:feasible-erm`, consistent with `def:upper-risk` and `oeq:feasible-upper`.

Per the OEQ rule this is a `Prop` `def` recording the open proposition: it
carries NO proof, no theorem is emitted for it, and no downstream theorem
depends on it. -/

  -- uniformly over the whole feasible-estimator class — the "feasible rate is exactly
  -- `g_joint`" determination, with the converse constant chosen BEFORE fixing the estimator
