# Fixed-geometry continuum witness

The geometry handle fixes the source/target laws, weights, and propensity and
sets the first stage and compliance probability at exact effective strength.
The witness predicate records the continuum law's compliance-type and Bernoulli
moment identities without introducing a new causal typeclass.

/-! ### Measure-theoretic leaves for the witness

The following definitions spell out the three independent coins used by the
paper.  The first chooses compliance, the second chooses the common receipt
type when the unit is not a complier, and the third chooses the binary treated
outcome. -/

This parallel chain leaves the established centre witness unchanged.  Its
