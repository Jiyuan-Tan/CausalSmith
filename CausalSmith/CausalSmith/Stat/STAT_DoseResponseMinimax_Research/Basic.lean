# Sharp minimax lower frontier for interior continuous-dose response: shared core

Stage-2 scaffold for `stat_dose_response_minimax` (specialization
`holder_anisotropic_converse`).

This file carries the shared environment S-blocks (the i.i.d. observational
sampling world `DoseObs`/`DoseLaw`, the potential-outcome overlay, and the regime
constants), the assumption-atom `def`s, the model-class structure
`HolderDoseClass`, and the construction `def`s (`thetaFunctional`, `minimaxRisk`,
`publishedHoifRate`). Each emitted declaration carries its own node tag.

## Causalean substrate survey

| Submodule | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Causalean.Estimation.MinimaxATE.Model` (Obs/productLaw/nMSE) | bypass-justified | Finite-covariate (`X : Fin M`, `Y : Bool`) PMF world; here `X ∈ [0,1]^d`, `A ∈ [0,1]` with a continuous-in-treatment bump, so the single-observation law is a genuine `Measure` over Mathlib `MeasureTheory` + `Measure.pi`. |
| `Causalean.PO.*` (`POSystem`, `Consistency`, `CondIndepCF`) | bypass-justified | Graph/regime-indexed PO skeleton heavier than the scalar continuous-dose overlay; consistency + ignorability are kept as threaded `Prop`s on the constructed law, verified on the explicit two-point construction (F3). |
| `Causalean.Stat.Sample.IIDSample` | reuse (in `IidSampling`) | the i.i.d. sampling content of `ass:iid-sampling`. |
| `Causalean.Stat.Minimax.{LeCam,MinimaxRisk,Pinsker,ChiSquared}` | reuse target (Helpers) | Le Cam / TV ≤ √(KL/2) / χ² tensorization feed the divergence helpers; built on rather than discharged one-to-one. |
| `Causalean.Mathlib.Probability.BernoulliMeasure` | reuse target (Helpers/Divergence) | `bernoulliLaw_klDiv_le_four_sq_sub` is the `{0,1}` KL band ingredient. |

No new typeclasses are introduced.

The pushforward of the data law under `(A,X)` equals the measure with joint density
`(a,x) ↦ π_P(a∣x)·p_{X,P}(x)` w.r.t. Lebesgue on `[0,1]×[0,1]^d`. Together with
`PxIsXDensity` (the `X`-marginal is `p_{X,P}·Leb`) this pins `π_P(·∣x)` to be the GENUINE
conditional density of `A` given `X = x` under `P` — it is normalized
(`∫_{[0,1]} π_P(a∣x) da = 1` for `P_X`-a.e. `x`, forced by consistency of the joint with
its `X`-marginal) and tied to `dataMeasure`. Without it the `pi` field is disconnected
from `dataMeasure`, so the class `P_{α,β,s}` would be strictly BROADER than the paper
class (an arbitrary `π` field satisfying only the Hölder/positivity atoms, never required
to be the law's actual treatment density). The core symbol `pi_P(a∣x)` is *defined* as the
conditional density of `A` given `X = x` under `P`, so this tie is exactly the note's
stated meaning of `π_P`, not an added restriction. The leading conjunct ENFORCES the
declared density range `0 ≤ π_P` on `[0,1]×[0,1]^d`: with it `ENNReal.ofReal (π_P·p_{X,P})`
genuinely equals `π_P·p_{X,P}` (both factors nonnegative, using `PxHolder`'s `0 ≤ p_{X,P}`),
so the tie realizes the ACTUAL nonnegative conditional treatment density object, not only
its `ofReal` positive part.

/-! ## Environment S3 — regime constants and frontier sequences

These are the plain real/nat regime parameters and the two frontier sequences. They
enter every theorem as free binders (no measure-theoretic world of their own); their
declared spaces are ENFORCED by the standing well-formedness predicate
`RegimeConstants` below, which is threaded as a hypothesis into every regime
lemma/theorem so that no constant is ever used outside its declared space. The
per-symbol `@realizes` tags below are descriptive; the load-bearing realization is
the conjunction of `RegimeConstants` (for `alpha,beta,s,M,c_0,t_0,epsilon_0`) and the
`minimaxRisk` / `publishedHoifRate` defs (for `R_n,rho_n`).

@env: S3
@realizes alpha(regime constant `alpha : ℝ`, declared space `(0,∞)`; treatment-direction Hölder order)
@realizes beta(regime constant `beta : ℝ`, declared space `(0,∞)`; treatment-density Hölder order)

@realizes M(regime constant `M : ℝ`, declared space `(0,∞)`; common Hölder radius and outcome bound)
@realizes c_0(regime constant `c0 : ℝ`, declared space `(0,∞)`; local-positivity floor)
@realizes t_0(regime constant `t0 : ℝ`, declared space `(0,1)`; interior evaluation dose)
@realizes epsilon_0(regime constant `eps0 : ℝ`, declared space `(0,1/2)`; half-width of the evaluation window)
rho_n is realized by `publishedHoifRate` and its nonnegativity theorem.
@realizes R_n(frontier sequence `n ↦ minimaxRisk M n C t0 : ℝ`, declared space `[0,∞)^ℕ`; pointwise minimax MSE, `def:minimax-risk`)

Note: the i.i.d. `n`-sample setup symbol is NOT realized in this S3 regime-constants
block, and neither `publishedHoifRate`/`R_n` nor any other S3 object realizes it — S3
carries no sampling content. Its TWO load-bearing realizers (tagged on their own decls,
NOT here) are: (i) `IidSampling` (S1), whose `Causalean.Stat.IIDSample` conjunct supplies
the mutual independence + identical `P.dataMeasure` law and whose two a.s.-support
conjuncts pin each draw to `{A ∈ [0,1], X ∈ [0,1]^d}`; and (ii) the `n`-fold PRODUCT LAW
`Measure.pi (fun _ : Fin n => P.dataMeasure)` in `minimaxRisk`, the joint law of the
sample over `Fin n → DoseObs d`. (Neither `Consistency` nor `publishedHoifRate` realizes
the sample.)

`θ_P(t_0) = ∫_{[0,1]^d} μ_P(t_0,x) p_{X,P}(x) dx` (Lebesgue). Under consistency and
ignorability this equals the causal dose-response value `E_P[Y(t_0)]`. -/

/-- Pointwise minimax mean-squared risk
`R_n(C, t_0) = inf_{θ̂_n} sup_{P ∈ C} E_P[(θ̂_n - θ_P(t_0))^2]`.
The infimum ranges over MEASURABLE estimators truncated to `[-M,M]` (the
bounded-estimand range: truncating to the interval containing every `θ_P(t_0)`
never increases MSE and yields the SAME minimax value, while keeping the inner
squared loss bounded by `(2M)^2` under each `n`-fold probability law — so the
`⨆`/`⨅` are well-posed, with no junk-`0` inflation of the converse). -/
