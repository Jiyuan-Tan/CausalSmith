# Dose-response minimax lower bound: single-bind (channel) restructuring

The genuine joint data law `doseDataMeasure` was built as a nested
`X → A → Y` bind. For the conditional-mean (regression), ignorability, and KL
chain-rule arguments it is far cleaner to view it as a SINGLE bind of the shared
`(A,X)`-marginal `doseAXMeasure` against the outcome Markov kernel
`doseChannelAX`. This file records that restructuring and the marginal facts that
the downstream leaves consume.
