/-! # Latent two-point witnesses for the private CATE converse

Conditional on `X = x`, this file draws `Y(0)` and `Y(1)` independently on
`{-1,1}`, with respective means `0` and `b x`, and independently draws treatment
with probability `e0`.  The observed record is the consistency image `Y = Y(A)`.
Thus the counterfactual remains latent and the arm regressions are `mu0 = 0` and
`mu1 = b`, with contrast exactly `b`.
