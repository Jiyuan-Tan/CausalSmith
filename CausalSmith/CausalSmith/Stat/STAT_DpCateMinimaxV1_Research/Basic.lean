# Central-DP pointwise CATE minimax: a two-point / TV-contraction proof-method barrier — shared core

Stage-2 scaffold for `stat_dp_cate_minimax_v1` (specialization
`holder_central_dp`).

**Headline scope (faithfulness).** This development proves a subfield-tier
PROOF-METHOD hardness result, NOT a sharp/matching minimax frontier. The headline
`thm:causal_dp_two_point_barrier` is a two-point / TV-contraction proof-method
OBSTRUCTION (never an impossibility claim, never a minimax converse). The
two-sided bracket `certified_private_cate_bracket` is NON-matching in general and
sharp only at `beta = gamma`; that `beta = gamma` sharp rate is INHERITED from
private pointwise regression, not a new causal exponent. The full-frontier
question is left as the non-theorem `CausalDpFrontierQuestion` Prop `def` on which
NO theorem depends.

This file carries the shared environment S-blocks (the i.i.d. observational CATE
sampling world `CateObs`/`CateLaw` with its potential-outcome overlay, the central
approximate-DP release overlay, and the regime constants + Hölder classes), the
assumption-atom `def`s, the model-class structure `HolderCateClass`, the
construction `def`s (`dpMinimaxRisk`, `nonprivateCateRate`,
`privateRegressionCalibration`, `causalPrivateFrontierHandle`), and the open-ended
`CausalDpFrontierQuestion`. Each emitted declaration carries its own node tag.

## Causalean substrate survey

| Submodule | Decision | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Causalean.Stat.Sample.IIDSample` | reuse (in `IidSampling`) | the i.i.d. sampling content of `ass:iid`. |
| `Causalean.PO.*` (`POSystem`, `Consistency`, `CondIndepCF`) | bypass-justified | graph/regime-indexed PO skeleton heavier than the scalar CATE overlay; consistency + exchangeability kept as threaded `Prop`s on the constructed law (same call as sibling `DoseResponseMinimax`). |
| `CausalSmith.Stat.DoseResponseMinimax.HolderBallND` | bypass-justified (NOT reused) | its `⌊order⌋` convention gives a `0`-exponent condition at integer smoothness, disagreeing with this core's standard `⌈s⌉-1` convention; `HolderBallStd` is define-local. |
| `Causalean.Stat.Minimax.TotalVariation` / `ChiSquared` | reuse target (Helpers) | `tvDist`, `one_sub_tvDist_le_test`, `chiSqDiv`, `tvDist_le_half_sqrt_chiSqDiv`. No DP substrate exists anywhere; the DP overlay/contraction/Laplace release are build-inline. |

No new typeclasses are introduced.

stated MEANING of the nuisance symbols (encoding fidelity), not added
restrictions. Without them `τ_P = μ_{1,P} - μ_{0,P}` would be disconnected from
`dataMeasure`, and `thm:causal_dp_two_point_barrier`

coincide at `n·ε = 1`, the `q`-power strictly exceeds the `γ`-power only when
`n·ε > 1` and `q < γ`); (e) the TWO-POINT / TV-CONTRACTION BARRIER LIMITATION (any `Δ`
certified through the DP TV-contraction budget is capped at the `γ`-privacy order, so
the ordinary two-point route cannot reach the `q`-branch); (f) the DENSITY/GRAM-STABLE
QUALIFICATION (the KBRW nonprivate value matches the genuinely NONPRIVATE minimax risk
only on a nonempty density/Gram-stable submodel containing an admissible i.i.d. law,
not the full positive-density class); (g) the private-HOIF
COMPONENT-STABILIZATION NECESSITY, stated as a UNIVERSAL/CONDITIONAL requirement on an ACTUAL
ASSEMBLED, already-private HOIF upper program (a central-DP release `M` that is GENUINELY ASSEMBLED —
post-processed via a fixed measurable assembly map from the JOINT release of four NAMED
internal fold releases, nuisance-pilot/Gram/first-order-score/second-order, so each fold is a
COMPONENT TIED TO `M` and is essential on the actual fold laws; all five releases are
measurable probability kernels, and the assembled CATE release carries a named HOIF error
decomposition whose four stochastic terms are pinned to their corresponding fold releases
and whose third-order component is exactly the KBRW Gram/density remainder): for EVERY such
program, each of the four folds is
SEPARATELY either an actual privatized release (`CentralDP`) or GENUINELY GLOBALLY STABILIZED
(`GloballyStabilized`: a finite global-sensitivity Δ-shift bound on neighboring output laws,
NOT output clipping). Privacy is one of the two per-fold alternatives; the requirement is
per COMPONENT and conditional on being an actual assembled program — NOT an existential
asserting a program exists, NOT inferred from a single-release risk-control premise, no
foldwise CATE-risk premises, and no whole-release clipping. **NON-CERTIFICATION.**
None of these clauses is a proved risk envelope, attainable rate, minimax frontier, or
minimax elbow; this is a formal `def` object only (never a theorem, no proof) consumed
as context by `CausalDpFrontierQuestion`. The class parameters `L, e₀, f₀, f₁, x₀` are
carried so clauses (f)–(g) can name the actual model class. Clause (e) is a VERBATIM
mirror of the headline theorem `causal_dp_two_point_barrier` part (ii): it quantifies over
its OWN admissible budget SEQUENCE `(ε_·, δ_·)` and a fresh sample-size binder `m`, with the
γ-branch constant `Ceta` chosen UNIFORMLY in `m` (`∃Ceta` before `∀m`) and ranging over
ARBITRARY class members (no `IidSampling` restriction); it does NOT use the handle's scalar

/-- **OPEN QUESTION (acknowledged open problem, not a theorem).** Under the frozen
privacy budgets (`PrivacyBudget eps del`) and the regime `0 < β ≤ γ`, the residual
frontier question over the full positive-density class
`P_{α,β,γ}(L,e₀,f₀,f₁,r₀,x₀)` records the note's UNRESOLVED ALTERNATIVES — NOT a flat
conjunction asserting three simultaneous global equivalences (which would be false in
general, as the bracket is non-matching for `β < γ`). It poses the existence of a
sharp two-sided rate `r`, WITH the note's stipulated causal-lower-bound requirement,
and leaves the phase structure as a genuine DISJUNCTION:

* the sharp rate `r` characterizes `R_n^{DP}` two-sided, AND any matching lower bound
  is witnessed by a CAUSAL LOCALIZED FAMILY (a two-point pair in the class with
  `μ₀ = 0`, constant propensity `e₀`, shared covariate design, and a localized
  `γ`-Hölder `μ₁` perturbation) — a regression stand-in is NOT permitted;
* **phase alternatives (disjunction — "which regimes occur"):** `r` is EITHER the
  formal frontier `ρ_n^{alg}` alone (`causalPrivateFrontierValue`), OR the
  pointwise-regression calibration `r_n^{regDP}` adds a regime, OR private nuisance
  estimation adds ONE OR MORE further leading regimes (an extra rate dominating
  `ρ_n^{alg}`);
* **privacy-free reduction (open sub-question):** whether the maximal-budget
  (`ε_n = 1`) proxy for the privacy-free full-class limit REDUCES to the KBRW
  benchmark `r_n^{CATE}` (`nonprivateCateRate`) — posed as the disjunction "reduces,
  OR there is a strictly larger sharp rate", not asserted.

It is stated here as a Prop `def` ONLY; it is NOT a theorem, carries NO proof, and NO
theorem in this development depends on it. -/
