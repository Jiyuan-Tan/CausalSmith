/-- Every point of the selected grid, boundary-layer or mesh, lies between the pole
offset and one.  This is the range fact the prior lift needs so that grid values can
serve as cell masses. -/

equal to the calibrated pole scale. -/

/-- A polynomial of degree at most `n` splits as its constant term plus `x` times the
polynomial whose coefficients are the original ones shifted down by one.  Dividing
this identity by `x` is what expresses `P(x)/x` as a reciprocal term plus an honest
polynomial, matching the selection basis. -/
