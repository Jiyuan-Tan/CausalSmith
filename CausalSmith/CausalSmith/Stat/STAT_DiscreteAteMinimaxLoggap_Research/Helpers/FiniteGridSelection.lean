# Selected finite grid for the one-arm approximation obstruction

This file builds the explicit finite grid used by the one-arm hard-prior
construction — three boundary-layer points near the pole together with an
oversampled Chebyshev--Lobatto mesh of the remaining interval — and shows that on
this grid the propensity-type target `x / (x + a)` cannot be approximated to
better than a fixed constant by the span of the reciprocal and the monomials up
to degree `n`.  The resulting positive best-approximation error is converted into
a pair of Jordan priors matching all of those test functions.

/-- The pole offset `a = 1 / (10¹⁰ n²)` used throughout the one-arm construction.
It is the amount by which the propensity-type target `x / (x + a)` is shifted away
from a genuine singularity at the origin; the inverse-square dependence on `n` is
calibrated so that a degree-`n` polynomial cannot resolve the boundary layer. -/
