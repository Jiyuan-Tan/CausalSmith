# Overlap-calibrated grid scale

The smallest positive node shrinks by `κ⁴`; the rational pole is `κ` times
that node.  This keeps endpoint polynomial variation on the same `κ²` scale
as the shifted three-point signal.

/-- The smallest positive node of the overlap-shifted approximation grid,
`κ⁴ / (10¹⁰ D²)`.  Shrinking it like `κ⁴` and like `1/D²` keeps the polynomial
variation across the three small nodes on the same `κ²` scale as the
three-point signal being obstructed. -/
