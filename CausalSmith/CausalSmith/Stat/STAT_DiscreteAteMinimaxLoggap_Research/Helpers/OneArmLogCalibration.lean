/-- The chosen degree is at least the real number it rounds up, namely
8·log n / log 2 (base-2 logarithm scaled by 8), whenever the sample size is at
least 2.  This is the lower half of the ceiling sandwich used to convert degree
budgets into logarithmic rates. -/

/-- The chosen degree is strictly less than 8·log n / log 2 plus one, for sample
size at least 2.  This is the upper half of the ceiling sandwich, so the degree
never exceeds its target by more than a single unit. -/

/-- The chosen degree is strictly positive once the sample size is at least 2,
so the moment-matching construction always has at least one moment to match. -/

/-- Equivalent calibration with raw sample scale `4n`.  Halving the active
mass scale leaves every Poisson rate, and hence the Taylor budget, unchanged;
the larger total mean supplies uniform de-Poissonization slack. -/
